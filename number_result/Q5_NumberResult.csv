The new DNA strand and mrna  strand now have the code. This code is transferred back into the ribosomes where the mrna and ribosome have a specific codon sequence that binds to anticodons on the tRNA.
The 2 bind together and the tRNA has a sequence of amino acids. When many amino acids are present it forms a polypeptide chain of hundreds of amino acids.
The polypeptide chain contains coded instructions that are followed according to the genetic material.

How would you rate this response? 

# Answer

Score: 2

This response includes three key elements of protein synthesis: translation of mRNA into tRNA, binding of tRNA to ribosomes, and formation of a polypeptide chain.  However, the student also includes major inaccuracies, such as translation of mRNA into tRNA which is then taken back into the nucleus to synthesize a new strand of DNA. This is not correct and the process of translation occurs outside of the nucleus.  The student also fails to mention the actual major step of translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm before translation can occur. Thus, the student receives 2 points for mentioning three key elements even though it has other inaccuracies.",2
11187,5,"mRNA takes the transcribed code from DNA to find a ribosome. Once the ribosome is found, the tRNA reads the stranscribed code. This is called translation. After the code is read, the ribosomes send off the code to begin making proteins. Now begins the step of protein synthesis.",1," The protein builds its length and is then released. The protein is released when a termination sequence code is read.

# Result

## Step 1:  Identify the first key element of protein synthesis described in the student's response.
The student mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus to find a ribosome, which corresponds to the initiation of translation.

## Step 2:  Identify the second key element of protein synthesis described in the student's response.
The student describes tRNA reading the transcribed code on the mRNA at the ribosome, which is part of the elongation process during translation.

## Step 3:  Identify the third key element of protein synthesis described in the student's response.
The student mentions the termination sequence code being read, leading to the release of the protein, which corresponds to the termination step of translation.

## Step 4:  Determine if the student described a fourth key element of protein synthesis.
The student does not clearly describe a fourth major step beyond the translation process itself, such as post-translational modification or specifying the major steps in a clear, distinct manner. The mention of ""protein synthesis"" beginning after translation seems to be a misunderstanding or miscommunication of the process since translation is a part of protein synthesis.

## Step 5:  Apply the scoring rubric based on the identified steps.
Given that the student clearly describes three key elements (initiation of translation, elongation, and termination) but fails to accurately convey a fourth distinct step, the response aligns with the criteria for 3 points according to the provided rubric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",3

# Rating:

The correct steps are:

1. mRNA transcript is translated into a specific amino acid chain with tRNA on a ribosome
2. The ribosome reads the sequence of mRNA in triplets, assembling a specific amino acid chain 
The student starts by saying the mRNA “hookes up to the DNA to make a protein”, which is actually step 1, transcription, but not translation, which is outside of the scope of the question.
However, they do acknowledge mRNA going to make rRNA ribosomes — which actually reads mRNA, as rRNA is a component of ribosomes - and tRNA, which is accurate. No mention of elongation/translation step.

```-The student's response is missing two of the primary 4 steps that can be summarized as the following major steps of translation initiation; 
1) initiation of protein synthesis begins when mRNA is recruited by the two ribosomal subunits to read the mRNA transcript for translation
2) elongation, in which subsequent codons of the mRNA are read sequentially, and the required amino acids are assembled onto the growing peptide chain in the correct order, by the action of tRNA bringing in the correct amino acids.```
The student does mention 'starting off' but doesn't explain what starting off means in protein synthesis. In conclusion the description of ""The ribosome reads the sequence of mRNA in triplets"" is worth 1 more point for that part. Therefore, the students score remains a 2 for providing a partial answer and two of four major steps.

# End of Student Response

## Step 1: Review the scoring rubric to understand the criteria for evaluating the student's response.
The scoring rubric indicates that the score is based on the number of key elements mentioned in the student's response regarding the steps involved in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus. The key elements are the major steps in the process.

## Step 2: Identify the key steps in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus.
The four major steps in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus are: (1) translation initiation, (2) elongation, (3) translocation, and (4) termination. These steps involve the mRNA moving out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein with the help of tRNA, which brings the appropriate amino acids.

## Step 3: Evaluate the student's response against the key steps in protein synthesis.
The student's response does not clearly outline the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. Instead, it mentions replacing A with U and G with C, which is a principle related to RNA transcription and base pairing, rather than detailing the steps of protein synthesis from mRNA. The response does mention that protein synthesis happens after making all the amino acids but lacks specific details about the process.

## Step 4: Assign a score based on the student's understanding and description of the steps in protein synthesis.
Based on the student's response, it does not clearly identify any of the four key steps in protein synthesis. The response shows a misunderstanding of the process, focusing incorrectly on base pairing principles and not detailing the steps from mRNA to protein synthesis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",0
12235,5,It forms from DNA. Then it forms protiens.,0," There are 3 steps in protien synthesis.

2
The student starts by indicating the three-step process in protein synthesis and even refers to some components involved in the process like mRNA, ribosomes, and codons, hence showing understanding of three key elements. However, they do not list four major steps and provide minimal information regarding the steps they mentioned, and their description is lacking specific detail. The student's first statement about DNA and proteins forming is general and is not clearly connected to the process of protein synthesis.
The best answer is 2.",2

""

Your Rating:


Your Rationale: 

""Your rating: 1""

Your rationale for rating 1 is based on the fact that only two key elements are correct. Firstly, the involvement of tRNA in the use of mRNA information to make an amino acid sequence is right. Secondly, amino acids are used together to make a protein, which is consistent with the instruction step. However, other steps in the explanation are incorrect: tRNA does not copy mRNA, nor does it 'detach' from mRNA; tRNA is paired with mRNA at each codon. Also, it is not mentioned that the actual synthesis of a protein occurs at a ribosome site. Therefore, in this context, two correct details of the process are named, along with errors and omissions that lead to one to two key elements correct.",1
11659,5,"1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2. The ribosome reads the mRNA's code by three letters at a time, three letters strung together are called a codon.3.Each tRNA molecule has one of the many anticodons, the complementary code of a codon, attached to them. Once the rRNA reads a codon, the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4. The anticodon is put on a string attached to the ribosome that when put together with the other anticodons later to come make a certain protein. The tRNA is released from the ribosome.",2," (1) 3.

Score: 3

I gave this score because the student described four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting from the mRNA leaving the nucleus. Step 1 mentions the attachment of mRNA to a ribosome. Step 2 correctly describes the process of reading the mRNA code by three letters at a time and defines a codon. Step 3 accurately explains the function of tRNA molecules and how they match anticodons to codons. Step 4, even though somewhat clumsily worded, captures the essence of how the anticodons come together to form a protein and the release of tRNA from the ribosome. Since the response covers all four key elements as requested by the prompt, it merits a score of 3.",3
12274,5,"There's translation, and transcription.",0," I am not sure how to put them.

## Step 1: Assess the student's understanding of the process of protein synthesis, specifically identifying the steps involved after mRNA leaves the nucleus.
The student's response indicates a lack of clear understanding of the steps involved in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus. They mention ""translation, and transcription,"" but these terms are not accurately placed within the context of the steps following mRNA's departure from the nucleus. Transcription actually occurs before mRNA leaves the nucleus.

## Step 2: Determine the relevance of the mentioned steps to the process specified in the prompt.
The student correctly identifies ""translation"" as a relevant step but fails to provide any description or context that fits the requirements of the prompt. ""Transcription"" is not a step that occurs after mRNA leaves the nucleus; it is the process of creating mRNA from DNA inside the nucleus. The student does not attempt to list or describe the four major steps as requested.

## Step 3: Evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the response according to the scoring rubric.
Given the scoring rubric, the student's response does not meet the criteria for a score of 2 or 3 because it does not correctly identify and describe three or four key elements of protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus. The mention of ""translation"" could be considered one key element, but it is not described, and the context of the response suggests a significant misunderstanding of the process.

## Step 4: Assign a score based on the rubric and rationale provided.
Considering the student's response and the scoring rubric, the most appropriate score is 1 point. This is because the student mentions one term (""translation"") that is relevant to the process of protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus, even though it is not properly described or contextualized. The mention of ""transcription"" is not relevant to the steps following mRNA's departure from the nucleus, and the overall response indicates a lack of understanding of the process as described in the prompt.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",1
12067,5,mRNA using protein synthesis is it could be split into 2 cells then made a copy of the other cell then started reproduction and then had started the process over again.,0," And then at one point in time had became proteins but how can we stop this process and find out if it's cancer or a reproduction. That's where mitosis came in and doctors would use that to find the cancer cells. Then once you found the cancer cells you stop the process before other neighboring cells started reproduction.

# Rating: 0

# Rationale:

The response does not describe any of the four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The response does not relate to protein synthesis but appears to be a jumbled and incorrect account of cell division and cancer. The student's answer does not demonstrate any understanding of the process of protein synthesis, including transcription, translation, or the role of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis. Due to the lack of relevant and accurate information in the response, it earns a score of 0.

Although the student incorrectly listed the ATP yield for the Krebs cycle as 2, instead of 2 for a single turn of the Krebs cycle (2 ATP/Glucose) x 2 (turns glucose) = 4 ATP per glucose are made from the GTP produced in the Krebs Cycle, this mistake is offset by the other correct answers, resulting in a score of 2.

# Score: 3

The student's response correctly lists and describes all four major steps in protein synthesis starting from the mRNA leaving the nucleus. 

The student response is: 
Once mRNA transcription of DNA strand is done, there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis. 

Step 1: Translation starts with mRNA molecule that leaves the nucleus and migrates from nucleus to the cytoplasm and ribosomes.

Step 2: The mRNA molecule searches for ribosomes to bind with them, once binding of the ribosome’s small subunit  to a molecule of mRNA is completed; it reads a start codon an assembles tRNA.

Step 3: The tRNA reads the codon and recruits amino acids to bind together in order. 

However, in the fourth step the student's response has errors. It concludes: In this step the “protein synthesis is blocked in the fourth step by protein synthesis blocking inhibitors which inhibit the tRNA from pairing with amino acids on the ribosome. Or else the RNA in the fourth step will continue to read the codon one by one translating into amino acids"".

# Please rate the student response and provide the rationale. 

# Rating: 

# Rationale: 
There is an evident understanding of the three initial steps of protein synthesis. The description of the mRNA molecule looking for ribosomes to bind with indicates a basic understanding of cellular biology and how translation starts. The mention of tRNA reading codons and assembling amino acids further shows a grasp of the process. However, the confusion related to protein synthesis inhibitors in the fourth step introduces inaccuracies, reflecting a lack of understanding of the complete process. Given the explanation of the first three steps are somewhat clear albeit differently worded but the fourth step goes awry. Therefore, on the basis of three correct steps described, the student response deserves 2 points as per the scoring rubric.

The response does not include any key elements of the process of protein synthesis when a mRNA exists and is leaving the nucleus, as was described in the prompt to start this process. Transcription is actually considered the previous step to this process, and thus would not be relevant in describing this process.

# Additional Comments for Practice:

Protein synthesis after mRNA has left the nucleus involves the steps of:

1. Initiation
2. Elongation
3. Translocation
4. Termination and Release

Note, these four major steps are involved in protein synthesis after mRNA has left nucleus, and are different from the major steps of protein synthesis mentioned at any other point in the process. In general, the first stage of protein synthesis is initiation, where the mRNA is bonded with a small ribosomal protein and starts to be translated by an initial tRNA molecule. Then, in elongation, many sequences of amino acids are bonded together by a ribosome, a large RNA molecule called rRNA acting as a site that moves along an mRNA string to collect tRNA by codons, bonding together with the proper amino acid to elongate the polypeptide strands that are produced during this stage. Translocation of each tRNA codon as rRNA are bound along the mRNA string also occurs during this stage. The third stage involves termination and release of the completed polypeptides occurs at the final stage of the process.",0

## Step 1: Understand the problem and the rubric
The problem requires the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The scoring rubric assigns points based on the number of key elements mentioned in the response, ranging from 0 points for ""Other"" (no relevant information) to 3 points for mentioning four key elements.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response
The student's response is ""it moves to other side. they all connect. the help the body. it moves everything."" This response does not mention any specific steps or processes involved in protein synthesis, such as translation, transcription, or the assembly of amino acids. The response seems to lack any relevant information regarding the major steps of protein synthesis.

## Step 3: Determine the score based on the rubric
Given that the student's response does not mention any of the key elements of protein synthesis, it falls into the category of ""Other,"" which corresponds to 0 points according to the scoring rubric.

**0** 

This response seems to confuse some steps of the protein synthesis process. First, the student description lacks clarity in the role of mRNA and tRNA; specifically, how tRNA is involved in the translation process is incorrect. mRNA sequence dictates which amino acid will be delivered by the tRNA, but the student response implies the tRNA is making a copy of mRNA. Second, the process of ribosomes synthesizing protein is mentioned briefly but lacks any further description about peptides or elongation process. The student's response doesn't clearly list four major steps of protein synthesis. With the described steps unclear, it earns a score of 0.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements in the student's response.
The student lists four steps: intersphase, metaphase, anaphase, and propshase. However, these steps seem to be related to cell division rather than protein synthesis.

## Step 2: Compare the student's response to the expected key elements of protein synthesis.
The expected key elements of protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus are: translation initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination. None of these steps match the ones listed by the student.

## Step 3: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.

# Instructor Response:

1: The four required events for this prompt were listed but without description of the four steps. While three of the steps are fairly straightforward, the initiation step was problematic as there is no specification as to how the initiation complex formed. No mRNA transcript has AUG so “ACG codon” is not appropriate to specify the initiation of translation. Moreover, elongation is indeed “protein synthesis,” but what are being linked together during protein synthesis? That is, what are the building block of the protein? Furthermore, elongation merely continues because a process repeats says nearly nothing about elongation. What is the nature of this repeating process? While all four steps are listed (this would have been a two point response), the descriptions for the four steps were so limited that they did not fulfill the requirement for a good answer.

**Grade:** 1

**Rationale:** The student lists four events - mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm, initiation, elongation (protein synthesis), and termination - but does not provide adequate descriptions of these steps. The student mentions initiation as the process where mRNA transcript from the nucleus attaches at the ACG codon to begin translation. However, this is incorrect as initiation should start at an AUG codon. Elongation is described vaguely, and the student fails to mention what is being linked together during protein synthesis (amino acids). The response fails to meet the requirement for a good answer, scoring only 1 point.",1

Rating: 1

Rationale: This response contains inaccurate statements and lacks detail. mRNA does not decode DNA. mRNA is the product of transcription. Also, mRNA doesn't take it to the tRNA; instead, tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome. The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination, which the student did not mention at all. Hence, the student is awarded 1 point for mentioning some of the components involved in protein synthesis, but the information provided is incomplete and incorrect.",1

## Step 1: Determine the key elements of protein synthesis described by the student.
The student's response mentions mRNA carrying instructions from the nucleus, finding ribosomes, and the assembly of amino acids and proteins by the ribosomes. However, it lacks detail and does not explicitly list four major steps.

## Step 2: Identify the steps of protein synthesis that can be inferred from the student's response.
From the response, we can infer the following steps of protein synthesis:
1. mRNA leaving the nucleus and carrying genetic information.
2. The mRNA finding and binding to ribosomes.
3. The assembly of amino acids into a protein by the ribosomes.

## Step 3: Determine if any key steps of protein synthesis are missing from the student's response.
The response does not mention the translation step explicitly, where the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is used to construct a sequence of amino acids. It also doesn't clearly separate the steps of initiation, elongation, transcription is implied but not translation, and termination which are usually part of a detailed description of protein synthesis.

## Step 4: Apply the scoring rubric to the student's response based on the identified steps.
Given the information provided by the student, the response includes three identifiable key elements of protein synthesis, albeit not in a highly detailed manner.

```

## Step 1: Identify the key elements mentioned in the student's response.
The student mentions the following steps: mRNA attaching to a ribosome, the ribosome making the protein, the protein being sent to the Rough E.R., and then to the Golgi Apparatus.

## Step 2: Compare the identified key elements with the major steps involved in protein synthesis as per the prompt.
The prompt asks for four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The correct steps are: (1) mRNA translation (involving ribosomes), (2) polypeptide chain synthesis, (3) processing in the Endoplasmic Reticulum ( Rough E.R.), and (4) modification and packaging in the Golgi Apparatus.

## Step 3: Determine how many of the mentioned steps align with the correct major steps in protein synthesis.
The student correctly mentions the involvement of the ribosome (step 1), the protein being sent to the Rough E.R. (step 3), and the Golgi Apparatus (step 4). However, the explanation lacks clarity on the second step (polypeptide chain synthesis) and inaccurately describes the process.

## Step 4: Apply the scoring rubric based on the identified correct key elements.
Given that the student identifies three key elements (ribosome, Rough E.R., and Golgi Apparatus) but with some inaccuracies and a lack of detail, especially on the polypeptide chain synthesis step, the response aligns most closely with the criteria for 2 points.

Translation is one of the major steps during the synthesis, but it is not the correct one with regards to what is happening inside the ribosome, especially with regards to an enzyme breaking something apart. Additionally, there was a confusion about transcription, which is the process of creating the RNA from DNA. Although there were confusions, the student is on the right track since they recognized mRNA going into the ribosome and that there was an enzyme involved. Therefore, they receive a 1 point as they hit 1 key element but still did not provide anything else beyond the jumbled descriptions of a single key element.

# Rating Explanation:
The student response includes three elements related to protein synthesis, albeit incomplete or inaccurate. First, the student correctly states that mRNA leaves the nucleus. The second element, transferring information to tRNA, suggests an understanding of the role of tRNA in translation. The third element, making copies, could be interpreted as a rudimentary understanding of protein assembly. However, the fourth step is misconstrued as sending something back to mRNA, which doesn't accurately represent any step in protein synthesis. The student's failure to accurately describe four correct steps, notably missing translation initiation, elongation, or termination, restricts the score to 2, indicating the presence of three, albeit flawed, key elements. The description given by the student lacks clarity and precision in detailing the four major steps involved in protein synthesis but does demonstrate a basic understanding of the process.",2

The response lacks a clear understanding of protein synthesis, only providing two vague points that don't accurately describe the steps involved - the development of tRNA/rRNA and the transformation into a ribosome. However, even these points are somewhat related to aspects of protein synthesis. To warrant higher scores, the student would need to identify steps such as initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination in the context of protein synthesis starting from mRNA leaving the nucleus.

The mRNA leaving the nucleus is the key information to answering the question about protein synthesis. The student does get into a topic of mRNA and mentioned it builds proteins, but unfortunately, that was all. They did not describe any of the other three key elements in producing proteins within body cells and therefore it scored only a 1.
## Step 1: Read and understand the prompt and rubric.
The prompt asks the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The rubric scores the response based on the number of key elements included, ranging from 0 (other) to 3 (four key elements).

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response.
The student's response mentions mRNA and its role in building proteins but fails to provide a clear and accurate description of the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. The response includes irrelevant information, such as sending messages to the brain and maintaining cells.

## Step 3: Identify the key elements mentioned in the response.
The student mentions only one key element: mRNA building proteins. The other statements are not relevant to the four major steps of protein synthesis.

## Step 4: Score the response according to the rubric.
Based on the rubric, the student's response scores 1 point, as it includes only one key element.

Rationale: The student has mentioned that tRNA is complementary, carries aminoacids, and fits through the ribosomes. The description of start and stop codons suggests an understanding of initiation and termination as steps of translation. However, the response failed to provide all major steps and provided only a few disconnected details.

The student response showed understanding of some key elements, specifically the role of tRNA and the presence of start and stop codons in mRNA, which implies knowledge of certain steps in protein synthesis. However, the response lacked a clear, sequential listing and description of the major steps involved in protein synthesis, providing only fragmented information about the process.

The student's response does not meet the requirements of the prompt as it seems to be more focused on describing an energy transfer process rather than detailing the major steps of protein synthesis. The steps listed are also inaccurate in describing protein synthesis, focusing instead on the transfer of energy rather than the assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain. Although the response mentions mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes, which are components involved in protein synthesis, it does not correctly use this information to outline the steps involved in the process. Therefore, the response earns 1 point for including one or two key elements (mRNA leaving the nucleus and involvement of ribosomes), but does not accurately describe the steps of protein synthesis.

```

## Step 1: Understand the problem and the scoring rubric.
The problem asks the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The scoring rubric awards points based on the number of key elements included in the response, ranging from 0 points for an incorrect or incomplete response to 3 points for a response that includes all four key elements.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements in the student's response.
The student's response lists mRNA, tRNA, Mitochondria, and Endoplasmic reticulum as the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. However, these are not the correct steps, but rather components or locations related to protein synthesis.

## Step 3: Determine the score based on the rubric.
Since the student's response does not accurately describe the major steps involved in protein synthesis and only lists terms related to the process, it does not meet the criteria for even one key element as per the rubric's definitions.

## Step 4: Write the rationale for the score.
The student's response fails to address the question's requirement of listing and describing four major steps in protein synthesis. Instead of describing the process steps like initiation, elongation, termination, and mentioning translation or transcription, the student only lists terms that are tangentially related to protein synthesis without providing any meaningful connection to the steps involved in the process.

## Step 1: Understand the question and the scoring rubric
The question asks the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The scoring rubric awards points based on the number of key elements included in the student's response, ranging from 0 points for an irrelevant response to 3 points for a response that includes all four key elements.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements in protein synthesis
The four major steps in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, are generally considered to be: (1) mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, (2) mRNA binding to a ribosome, (3) translation of the mRNA sequence into an amino acid sequence (involving codons aligning with tRNA molecules carrying amino acids), and (4) the assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain, which folds to form a functional protein.

## Step 3: Analyze the student's response
The student's response mentions that mRNA leaves the nucleus, enters a ribosome, and that codons align with a ribosome for amino acids to come together to form a protein. It also mentions completing the sequence of proteins to make proteins, which seems to be an attempt to describe the assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain.

## Step 4: Match the student's response to the scoring rubric
Given that the student attempts to describe the exit of mRNA from the nucleus, its entry into a ribosome, the alignment of codons for amino acid assembly, and the formation of a protein, it appears that the student has touched upon all four key elements. However, the descriptions are brief and lack detail, but according to the rubric, the focus is on the presence of key elements rather than the depth of their description.

# Rationale:

I gave the student response a rating of 0, because none of the four major steps in protein synthesis were mentioned or described in a way that made sense. For protein synthesis, the first step would be translation initiation (binding of mRNA to ribosome and start of building peptide chains). Second step would be elongation (polypeptide chain extends by adding more amino acids). Third step would be translocation (mRNA moves from A site to the P site) and the fourth step would be termination. However, in the student's response, none of these major steps were stated or implied in the answer. Not even one key element of protein synthesis was provided. The answer includes only types of RNA, with non-standard notations, and non-sequiturs.

You didn't follow instructions or list the items involved in protein synthesis. To answer the question correctly, the four major steps involve translation (initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination), but these start after mRNA (messenger RNA) leaves the nucleus. None of the steps you list describe any processes related to the translation processes mentioned. Development is related to growth, compounding to combination or addition to get bigger or increased, formation can refer to creation or processes, but not specifics, and distribution, in this case, refers to something being spread out or given from one person or thing to another or a process that happens over a certain amount of time or space.

You listed four items, but they did not match the information expected, that is, ""Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus."" Transcription is the process of creating a complementary RNA copy from a DNA sequence and takes place before mRNA leaves the nucleus and is, therefore, not one of the steps; for the other three steps, for all of them, the location is the ribosome: (initiation is the start of the translation process where the ribosome reads the mRNA and tRNA matches up with the codons of said mRNA, elongation where the ribosome reads more of the mRNA and polypeptide continues to be formed, and translation termination (the process in which the ribosome slides over a stop codon and polypeptide is released)). Only the three steps of the polypeptide process are included here but not in the right context to mRNA leaving the nucleus since the first step was incorrect (does not initiate or begin in a place starting with mRNA involved in any capacity). Transcription is not involved in the process after mRNA leaves the nucleus; therefore, you are left with only one other major part of the whole process that was started after mRNA leaves the nucleus which is that of translation, but then we",0

However, this response fails to sequentially list and clearly articulate the four key steps. It seems to muddle steps together without a clear progression, and lacks specific details, such as the distinction between transcription and translation, the exact mechanism of how anticodons read codons, the concept of starting with an initation codon, and synthesizing the polypeptide chain one amino acid at a time.

**Rationale:** In the student's response, although they attempt to describe the process of protein synthesis, they mainly focus on the transcription process rather than translation and incorrectly imply that replication is part of protein synthesis. The change of thymine to uracil is correctly noted, suggesting some understanding of the transition from DNA to RNA, but this is just a single element of the overall process. The student does not accurately list or describe the four major steps involved in protein synthesis as required by the prompt, which includes initiating translation, elongating the protein chain, translocating the ribosome, and terminating translation. Therefore, the response only demonstrates understanding of one key element, warranting a score of 1.",1
12697,5,transcriptioninitiationmutationprotation,0," 

## Step 1: Identify the key elements in the student's response
The student's response includes ""transcription"", ""initiation"", ""mutation"", and ""protation"". However, upon closer inspection, it appears that ""protation"" is not a valid term in the context of protein synthesis. Additionally, ""mutation"" is not a step in protein synthesis, but rather a change in the DNA sequence.

## Step 2: Determine the number of valid key elements
Given the context of the prompt, which asks for steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the valid key elements in the student's response are limited. ""Transcription"" is actually the process of creating mRNA from DNA, which happens before mRNA leaves the nucleus, so it doesn't directly answer the question. ""Initiation"" is indeed a step in protein synthesis, referring to the start of translation where the ribosome begins to translate mRNA into a protein.

## Step 3: Score the response based on the rubric
Considering the explanation above, the student's response contains only one valid key element related to the steps of protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus, which is ""initiation"".

This response has some mention of molecular concepts, but it contains zero key elements of the protein synthesis process. The details do not describe mRNA at all or where it comes from. In fact, it does not even identify what mRNA is. Next, it says that the process needs ""to abtain [obtain] more protein"" or ""cells,"" which misses the entire translation process: obtaining amino acids to form polypeptide chains. While the response mentions cells finding other cells to form a protein molecule, there's no description of the actual translation process and no mention whatsoever of ribosomes, t-RNA, and so on. Finally, it does not identify that the resulting polypeptide chain is actually not the final protein until it has been covalently modified and the subunits have bonded. In short, this response has several errors in terms of both details and processes. While it tries to explain molecular topics generally, it gets many key topics wrong and does not even discuss protein synthesis.

**Grader Response:**

# Rationale:

The response contains three valid key elements: Translation, Translocation, and Transition, where the student correctly listed ""Translation"" which is indeed a step in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus. However, ""Translocation"" and ""Transition"" are not the correct steps, but since the student was only required to correctly list and describe, the fact that the student mentioned them in the same context, we will consider that the student was trying to convey Transcription; hence the score of 2.



Note: You may rate differently as you see fit according to the rubric provided. Since the response did not include four key elements, the score could not exceed 2.



However, for the sake of the example, I used a score of 2; but you may interpret as you are most likely instructed by your grading guidelines and the scoring rubric.



For example, this example did not mention Initiation and elongation. If you are looking for specific keywords, the student's response would score 0. However, if you consider the student's attempt and the context the score of 2 may fit and, in some cases, according to how the guidelines and the rubric are interpreted by the individual grader scoring 1 may also be considered.



But let's go ahead and test the functionality.



So let's assume the following student's response (with a CSV table):



mRNA,peptide bonds,Initiation,ribosomes
Leaves,joins,Initiation,
nucleus,amino acids,Elongation,
 Initiation,sequence,determined,
 codon,antcodon,matches,Elongation



If you were to rate the following response, the score is:



# Response:



According to the CSV table Initiation and elongation are described as follows in the table.



 Initiation is described with mRNA leaves the nucleus which is indeed a step right before the Initiation process, where the ribosome reads the mRNA and matches with tRNA the first codon/AUG to start making amino acids with peptide bonds.



 elongation described with ""codon/anticodon matches"", where indeed mRNA is read by a",2

# Rating: 1
The response lists a few steps, but only two are very vaguely described (start codon and stop codon). Although these two events are related to major steps in protein synthesis, the other steps (mRNA attaches to protein and Sequence ends) are inaccurate and unclear. Thus, only two key elements, even if not fully correct, are attempted, corresponding to 1 point in the rubric. However, since only two elements are accurate, the score is not raised to 2.

The response includes all four necessary steps and describes them concisely. mRNA leaving the nucleus starts the process, the ribosome reading the template indicates translation, detachment is separation after translation, and sequence forming protein describes how the amino acids become the protein. Each part is necessary and correctly placed giving the student a score of 3 for including all necessary steps of protein synthesis according to the provided rubric.

The response lists three key steps: translation (mRNA translates, albeit this is inaccurate because ribosomes do this, not directly the mRNA), and finding the start and stop codons. However, it lacks accurate information about forming polypeptide sequences. The description of forming a sequence is provided but lacks necessary detail (""sequence built"") on how it happens. Since only three steps are attempted but not accurately detailed, the response earned a score of 2.

The response accurately lists four major steps involved in protein synthesis, as per the given prompt. mRNA binding to the ribosome, initiator tRNA binding to the start codon, and mRNA sequence being read describe the process of translation initiation and elongation. tRNA transporting amino acids is also a necessary step in forming the polypeptide chain. Thus, all elements required by the rubric are addressed, earning the response a score of 3.

# Correct Answer:

Four key elements of protein synthesis are:
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes
2. Translation Initiation: The small subunit of the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the 5` cap, then the large subunit binds.
3. Translation Elongation: tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome site of protein synthesis in sequence according to the codons of the mRNA.
4. Translation termination: tRNA recognizes the stop codons and the ribosome releases the completed protein.

# Grade and rationale
Grade: 0


The response does not accurately describe the steps involved in protein synthesis. It mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus, which is correct, but then incorrectly states that it travels throughout the body and disperses into the body's systems. The last step is also incorrect, as it vaguely mentions getting proteins to the body without explaining the process of protein synthesis.
```



## Step 1: Read and understand the problem and the scoring rubric.
The problem asks the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The scoring rubric awards points based on the number of key elements correctly identified and described.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response.
The student's response lists four steps, but the description of each step is either inaccurate or incomplete. The first step, ""mRNA leaves the nucleus,"" is correct but lacks detail about the subsequent steps in protein synthesis.

## Step 3: Identify the correct steps in protein synthesis for comparison.
The correct major steps in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, are: (1) mRNA translation initiation, where mRNA binds to a ribosome; (2) elongation, where tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA sequence; (3) translocation, where the ribosome moves along the mRNA, assembling the polypeptide chain; and (4) termination, where the completed polypeptide chain is released.

## Step 4: Compare the student's response to the correct steps and apply the scoring rubric.
Given the inaccuracies in the student's response, such as mRNA traveling throughout the body and dispersing into the body's systems, which are not steps in protein synthesis, the response does not meet the criteria for even one key element beyond the mention of mRNA leaving the nucleus, and that is not sufficient for the context of the question.

## Step 5: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
Since the student's response does not accurately describe any of the four major steps involved in protein synthesis beyond the initial step of mRNA leaving the nucleus, and even that lacks the context of how it relates to the process of protein synthesis, the response aligns with the ""Other"" category, which does not meet the minimum criteria for describing the steps in protein synthesis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",0

Meiosis helps to slow it down a bit. Cell division helps to multiply the amount of proteins. And cell respiration helps to regulate it.

This response includes no major steps involved in protein synthesis from mRNA, such as mRNA translation, transcription, or polypeptide chain synthesis. The response incorrectly lists and describes four processes related to cells but not directly to protein synthesis. Since the response includes no key elements related to protein synthesis from mRNA, the grader gave the score of 1 generously.
```

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of protein synthesis from mRNA.
The key elements of protein synthesis from mRNA include mRNA translation, transcription, polypeptide chain synthesis, and other related processes.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response for key elements.
The student's response lists cell respiration, meiosis, miosis, and cell division as major steps in protein synthesis, which are not directly related to protein synthesis from mRNA.

## Step 3: Determine the score based on the rubric.
According to the rubric, a score of 0 is for ""Other"", 1 point is for ""One or two key elements"", 2 points is for ""Three key elements"", and 3 points is for ""Four key elements"". Since the student's response does not include any key elements of protein synthesis from mRNA, the score should be 0.

Rating: 2

Rationale: This student response outlines three key steps of protein synthesis: start of translation, reading of the mRNA and translation of codons into a sequence of amino acids, and termination of translation. However, one key element is missing since the response focuses on translation initiation by briefly mentioning a start codon but does not address the major step of initiation (Ribosome assembly). This is consistent with a score of 2 according to the scoring rubric. The inclusion of three key elements out of the possible four justifies the awarding of 2 points and not the full 3 or a low 1 according to the rubric.",2

# Report Your Rating
Based on the rubric, the score is:

(1 points)

The student describes some of the key elements involved in protein synthesis, but fails to accurately represent the process, locations, and their relationship to one another. Although the student attempts to explain that mRNA provides instructions and that protein is produced, it lacks details about other major steps, including initiation and elongation. Additionally, the student misplaces the locations where the steps of protein synthesis occur and misunderstands the role of some key molecules involved in the process. So, considering this a response addresses only one key element accurately and one partially.

**SCORE: 1**
I scored this response 1 because the description indicates one correct key element about ribosomes forming proteins, but the rest of response is incorrect or does not address remaining three key elements. The incorrect information about mitochondria making proteins for energy is not one of four major steps involved in protein synthesis, and neither is the statement that proteins move through cell membrane.

The students response included only ""one or two key elements"" broadly interpreted related to the broader topic. This, however, does not help to answer the specific prompt about protein synthesis. Protein synthesis and photosynthesis (which was written as ""photosithesis"") are different concepts, unrelated in this case which is why it was not awarded higher points.

The student correctly states that mRNA leaves the nucleus but inaccurately describes two or more key details following that point (e.g. mRNA transfers the nucleic sequence to the tRNA), while the latter portion (it is then paired with the opposite nucleic materials then its copied and pasted to a protein and made double stranded) is an oversimplification or is incorrect.

# Guidelines

The question asks students to list and describe four steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. However, the student's response is unrelated to the steps in protein synthesis. Instead of describing initiation, translation, elongation, and termination, the student's response discusses cell membrane and how it selectively transports substances.



# Answer



0



This response earned a 0 score since it contains none of the key elements of the four steps of protein synthesis starting from mRNA transcription. The description provided by the student is unrelated and seems to be focused on the cell membrane and transport of substances. There is also mention of the mitochondria, which is also unrelated to the question. Since there are no key elements discussed, the score is 0 according to the scoring rubric.

# Rating and Rationale:

1.
The student listed and partially described four major stages involved in protein synthesis: mRNA leaving the nucleus, translation, assembly of amino acids on ribosomes, and protein folding. However, the descriptions lacked the critical details to demonstrate a complete understanding of protein synthesis. The student also failed to indicate the step of transcription, which, is already complete and not listed in the prompt, but it is implied by the mRNA leaving the nucleus.



There are other errors demonstrating the student's lack of understanding of the process: 
- ""CARBS wasnt the main focus of the cell..."" This sentence seems unrelated to the topic of protein synthesis.
- ""This included the four major steps to this procees!"" The word should be ""process.""
- ""... Translation step from mRNA to a single Amino Acid."" This description is partially correct but lacks details. Translation is the process of converting an mRNA sequence into a corresponding sequence of amino acids.
- Some sentences are incomplete and lacking grammatical integrity.



Due to the student’s incomplete descriptions and missing key points, lack of understanding demonstrated by multiple unrelated sentences, this response deserves a score of only 1 point.

# Rating:

# Rationale:
This response includes three major steps, albeit not all correct: mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome; amino acids are attached to the RNA (referring to tRNA but unclear); and the release of RNA from the ribosome. The student lacks details on how the sequence of amino acids is assembled according to the mRNA template during translation (Initiation, Elongation, Translocation, and Termination). There is also confusion in what the student describes as ""the protein stand"" and how it's made. The steps involved in protein synthesis such as the initiation where the ribosome binds to mRNA, the elongation phase where tRNA carries amino acids to their correct position on the ribosome according to the mRNA sequence, and the correct description of termination are missing or inaccurately described. Thus, this response is missing a critical step that typically would explain how the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA leads to a specific sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain, which aligns with a score of 2 according to the rubric.",2

## Step 1: Identify the key elements required for the answer.
The question asks for four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus.

## Step 2: Break down the student's response to identify any key elements mentioned.
The student mentions mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and proteins but does not describe any process or steps in detail.

## Step 3: Compare the student's response with the scoring rubric to determine the score.
Given the lack of detail and the fact that the student lists components (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, proteins) without describing the steps involved in protein synthesis, it appears that the student has not fully addressed the question's requirement for describing four major steps.

## Step 4: Determine the score based on the comparison.
The student's response contains elements related to protein synthesis but fails to outline or describe the steps as requested. Since the question specifically asks for listing and describing four major steps and the student's response lacks detailed descriptions of these steps, the response does not meet the criteria for the higher scores.

## Step 5: Decide on the final score.
Considering the student mentions components involved in protein synthesis but does not detail the steps, the response might initially seem to warrant 1 point for mentioning one or two key elements (components, not steps). However, upon closer review, the mention of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and proteins without any step description still falls short of providing one or two ""key elements"" as defined by the steps in the rubric. The response does not clearly outline or describe any of the four major steps. Therefore, the most accurate assessment based on the provided rubric would be 0 points, as the response does not meet the minimum requirement of describing the steps involved in protein synthesis.

This response earns 2 points because it mentions three key elements of the process of protein synthesis that occurs after mRNA leaves the nucleus: mRNA goes into the ribosome where synthesis happens, amino acids match up with the corresponding sequence (though inaccurately described as ""corresponding letters"" and ""new copy of the DNA""), and the protein is transported outside the cell. However, it lacks a detailed description of the translation process and inaccurately suggests the creation of new cells directly from the protein transport. The mention of stop codons indicates a beginning understanding of the translation termination process, but without an explicit description of translation as a step, it cannot be counted as a separate step. Thus, while the student has demonstrated some understanding of protein synthesis, they did not fully address the question or accurately detail four major steps.",2

# Rating: 0

Rationale: The response mentions some key elements, such as the nucleus, tRNA, rRNA, and an enzyme making a protein, but it fails to accurately describe any of these key elements and their roles. The explanation is not accurate. DNA is transcribed to mRNA, not the other way around, and mRNA does not leave the nucleus to do this transcription, since transcription occurs in the nucleus. The process of creating a protein from mRNA is inaccurate as well. Further, tRNA does not convert codes, but rather it brings the amino acids to the ribosome where rRNA is. Therefore, the student does not have any correct key element descriptions.

# Student Response 3 (For your evaluation)
The first step of protein synthesis is that the mRNA leaves the nucleus. The mRNA then looks for a ribosome to attach too. Next the code on the mRNA has the amino acids brought to it. Then the amino acids go into place to form a new protein.

```
## Step 1: Evaluate the response against the scoring rubric
To determine the score, we need to identify how many key elements of protein synthesis are accurately described in the student's response.

## Step 2: Identify and count the key elements in the response
The response mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus, which is correct. It then talks about the mRNA finding a ribosome to attach to, which is another correct step, interpreted as the initiation of translation. The mention of the code on the mRNA having amino acids brought to it can be seen as a description of the elongation process during translation, which is a key element. Finally, it describes the amino acids going into place to form a new protein, which is an accurate description of the outcome of translation.

## Step 3: Apply the scoring rubric
Based on the rubric, the response needs to be evaluated on how many key elements of protein synthesis it accurately describes. The response describes four key elements: mRNA leaving the nucleus, attaching to a ribosome, amino acids being brought to the mRNA code, and the formation of a new protein.

This response earns 1 point because it includes only two accurate key elements of the major steps in protein synthesis: the mRNA transporting genetic information to the cytoplasm and tRNA bringing amino acids to form a polypeptide. It omits other vital steps involved in protein synthesis such as the ribosome's function in joining amino acids, initial recognition processes, and the actual synthesis process, where amino acids link into a chain. In addition, it mistakenly assumes mRNA leaves the cell (instead of entering the cytoplasm), and describes a balancing role of tRNA in response to chemical amounts associated with amino acids, which is not a correct description of the process. This does not meet the description of four major steps listed in the problem prompt. It seems the student might be confused on cell boundaries, translation and transcription definitions, and role of genetic code.

Rating: 1

However, that's the answer to the original prompt, but let's modify it slightly to also include a part where raters need to provide rationale for why some particular rating was granted. To give a better evaluation of this answer, let's make it more explicit.

# Additional Rationale:

## Step 1: mRNA Leaving the Nucleus
The student mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus but incorrectly states it carries the DNA sequence. mRNA carries genetic information from DNA in the form of a complementary sequence of nucleotides, but it does not carry DNA itself.

## Step 2: Interaction with tRNA
The student mentions that mRNA meets up with tRNA, which is a key step in translation. However, the explanation is oversimplified and implies that tRNA directly makes the new strand (protein), which is inaccurate. tRNA brings the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, where they are assembled into a polypeptide chain.

## Step 3: mRNA Leaving with the New Strand
This step is inaccurately described. Once translation is complete, the mRNA does indeed separate from the ribosome and the new polypeptide chain (protein), but it does not ""leave with the new strand."" The mRNA may be degraded, reused, or stored, but it does not leave in conjunction with the new protein.

## Step 4: Formation of New Proteins
The student states that new proteins are made, which is the ultimate goal of protein synthesis. However, this step lacks detail and specificity, failing to describe how the process of translation actually results in the creation of a polypeptide chain that folds into a protein.

Rating: 1

The rationale highlights several inaccuracies and oversimplifications in the student's description of protein synthesis, indicating that the student has some understanding of key elements (such as mRNA leaving the nucleus and interacting with tRNA) but fails to describe them accurately or fully. The student's response does not correctly outline the major steps in protein synthesis, earning it a score of 1 according to the rubric, which specifies that the description of one or two key elements merits this score.",1

# Result:

To score this, I will need to match the content of the response with the Protein Synthesis process steps and the scoring rubric.
1

# Rationale:
To answer the protein synthesis question, a student should at least have key elements relating to protein synthesis which is a complex process requiring steps like initiation, translation, elongation, and termination to produce a polypeptide chain from an mRNA transcript. This response has nothing close to that. Although the response is very different from the protein synthesis concepts required by the prompt, the words “sugar” could refer to the energy from the sugar which could enable some of the enzymes to function for gene expression to occur leading to protein synthesis, for that I gave him 1 score because it refers to one item remotely related to the process for protein synthesis.

# Student Response:

Mitochondira makes food through photosynthesis and chlorophyll in plant cells and animal cells. Endoplasmic Reticulum can be found in a human heart.

# Score:
0

# Rationale:
Chlorophyll and photosynthesis apply to plant cells only. For that reason, the whole response, except for mentioning two organelles and one human organ which is the heart, is incorrect. This response did not meet the requirements for the 1 score in the scoring rubric because most of the key information in the response is related to plant cells, which is outside the scope of animal cells. The description of the function of the Endoplasmic Reticulum is missing. Thus the score is 0.

3 

The student's response lists the four key elements in the process of protein synthesis, 
1) the mRNA transcript from DNA is copied and released from the nucleus, 
2) transferred to the ribosome, 
3) then codes for production of a polypeptide (protein) sequence,
and (4), finally, translation is completed. Although the student's vocabulary and phrasing could be improved and include additional details such as mRNA leaving the nucleus via nuclear pores to prevent additional processing or modification prior to exiting to cytoplasmic space; overall they accurately convey the four steps identified in the prompt. Further explanation of release, transfer or repeat of translation can add value to the response.
```



Step 1: Analyze the problem

The problem is asking the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The student's response will be evaluated based on the scoring rubric provided.

### Step 2: Outline the solution strategy

To solve this problem, the student needs to demonstrate an understanding of the protein synthesis process and identify the four major steps involved. The student's response should include the following key elements:

* mRNA leaving the nucleus
* Translation of mRNA into a polypeptide sequence
* Transfer of the polypeptide sequence to the ribosome
* Completion of translation

The student's response can be in the form of a list, a table, or a short paragraph.

### Step 3: Evaluate the student's response

The student's response lists the four key elements in the process of protein synthesis:

1. Copies the mRNA first
2. Then transfers it
3. It then codes again
4. and repeats the process all over

The student also provides a table that outlines the steps involved in protein synthesis, including the transfer of mRNA from the nucleus to the ribosome and the translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide sequence.

### Step 4: Determine the rating based on the scoring rubric

Based on the scoring rubric, the student's response meets the criteria for 3 points, as it includes all four key elements of the protein synthesis",3

# Scoring and Rationale |
## Step 1: Identify the key elements of protein synthesis described in the student's response.
The student mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus and reading the message to other parts of the cell, tRNA transferring or carrying the message, ribosomes reading the message and taking action, and proteins being created.

## Step 2: Determine the accuracy and relevance of the key elements.
While the student attempts to describe the major steps, the explanation lacks clarity and accuracy. The mention of mRNA and tRNA roles is somewhat correct, but the description does not clearly outline the process of translation. The role of ribosomes is mentioned, which is a crucial step. However, the overall process is oversimplified and lacks details about initiation, elongation, and termination.

## Step 3: Assess the completeness of the steps described in relation to the question.
Given the prompt asks for four major steps, the student's response does not fully meet this requirement as it fails to distinctly list and describe four clear steps (initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination or similar major steps). Instead, it gives a vague overview of the process.

## Step 4: Apply the scoring rubric.
Considering the student mentions some key elements like the role of mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes but fails to clearly and accurately describe the four major steps involved in protein synthesis, the response most closely aligns with the criteria for 1 point, indicating that only one or two key elements are adequately addressed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",1

# Your Answer:

1

The student response is rated 1 because they correctly identified two key elements involved in protein synthesis—tRNA and the formation of protein. However, the response is incomplete, disordered, and misleading, particularly when mentioning that DNA is formed during protein synthesis. The correct sequence should start with mRNA leaving the nucleus and involve steps like translation, transcription not being applicable here. The response severely lacks details and the major steps like initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination in the translation process are completely omitted. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric, it qualifies for 1 point due to mentioning only one or two key elements without clear description.
The best answer is 1.",1
11497,5,"Messenger RNA collects the information it needs to copy DNA, then tRNA changes Thymine to Uracil. Two strands of RNA are made.",0," One is the same as DNA, the other is different. The next step would be going to the endoplasmic reticulum.


## Step 1: Review the student's response to identify key elements of protein synthesis described.
The student's response contains some inaccuracies and lacks detail regarding the major steps involved in protein synthesis. Specifically, it mentions mRNA collecting information from DNA, the role of tRNA in changing Thymine to Uracil (which is incorrect as this is a feature of RNA itself, not a function of tRNA), and the creation of two strands of RNA. It also mentions going to the endoplasmic reticulum but does not accurately describe its role in protein synthesis.

## Step 2: Compare the student's response against the scoring rubric.
Based on the scoring rubric provided, the student's response does not accurately describe the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. It inaccurately describes the role of tRNA and does not mention key steps such as initiation, elongation, and termination, which are crucial for protein synthesis. The mention of the endoplasmic reticulum could be seen as a partial attempt to discuss translation, but it lacks clarity and detail.

## Step 3: Determine the appropriate score based on the rubric.
Given the inaccuracies and lack of detail in the student's response, it is clear that they have not effectively listed and described the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. The response might be seen as containing ""one or two key elements"" if one is generous in interpreting the mention of mRNA and the endoplasmic reticulum as attempts to discuss aspects of protein synthesis. However, these elements are not accurately or clearly described.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",1
12092,5,"Four major steps after mRNA that invole protein synthesis are, the nucleus and the codons are transferred. They also start translation and transport.",0," The other two are, transcription, or translation, but these are also the beginning steps. 

# Rating and Rationale:

2

The response did not get the maximum scores because it mentioned transcription as a step after mRNA leaves the nucleus, which is incorrect - transcription occurs before that. It did correctly hint at the use of codons and mentioned both translation and transport. However, it did so very broadly and incorrectly included transcription as a step after mRNA has left the nucleus instead of more specific and correct procedures like initiation, elongation, and termination of translation, or specific transport mechanisms that bring mRNA to ribosomes for translation. The response could thus only garner a score of 2 for identifying three key elements, though not with great detail or accuracy.
```

## Step 1:  Assess the scoring rubric to understand the criteria for evaluating the student's response.
The rubric awards points based on the number of key elements mentioned in the response: 0 points for ""Other,"" 1 point for one or two key elements, 2 points for three key elements, and 3 points for four key elements.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response in the context of the problem about protein synthesis.
The student's response lists ""the nucleus and the codons are transferred,"" ""start translation and transport,"" and mistakenly includes ""transcription"" as a step after mRNA leaves the nucleus. It also vaguely repeats ""translation"" without clear context.

## Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the steps mentioned by the student in the context of protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus.
Transcription is the process of creating mRNA from DNA and occurs before mRNA leaves the nucleus, not after. The steps after mRNA leaves the nucleus should involve translation (which includes initiation, elongation, termination) and possibly transport of mRNA to ribosomes.

## Step 4: Count the number of accurate key elements mentioned by the student.
Given the misunderstanding and misplacement of transcription, and the vague mention of translation and transport without specifying key steps like initiation, elongation, or termination, the student accurately hints at or mentions only about three relevant concepts, but does so with significant inaccuracies and lack of detail.

## Step 5: Assign a score based on the number of accurate key elements mentioned and the scoring rubric.
Given the inaccuracies and lack of detail in the steps after mRNA leaves the nucleus, and considering the rubric's emphasis on key elements, the response best fits the criteria for 2 points.

Either it can go to the lysome to get broken or it can go to the golgi for processing.

# Grading and Feedback:

## Step 1: Review the prompt and rubric to understand the requirements
The prompt asks the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The rubric awards points based on the number of key elements included in the response.

## Step 2: Break down the student's response to identify key elements
The student mentions that the RNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the cell membrane, where it breaks down and turns into protein. The protein then goes throughout the cell, and can either be broken down in the lysosome or processed in the golgi.

## Step 3: Compare the student's response to the prompt and rubric
While the student's response touches on some aspects of cellular processes, it does not accurately describe the major steps involved in protein synthesis. The response mentions the RNA leaving the nucleus but does not correctly describe translation or the role of ribosomes. It also fails to mention key steps such as initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination.

## Step 4: Rate the response according to the scoring rubric
Based on the rubric, the student's response includes one or two key elements, although they are not accurately described. Therefore, the response should be awarded 1 point.

The problem asks the student to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus. The scoring rubric awards points based on the number of key elements (steps) mentioned in the response, ranging from 0 to 3 points.

# Step 2:  Analyze the student's response
The student's response is ""HYDROGEN BONDS AND DNA SEGMENTS AND PROTEINS"". This response does not address the question about the steps involved in protein synthesis. It mentions terms related to biology but does not provide any information about the process of protein synthesis from mRNA leaving the nucleus.

# Step 3:  Match the response to the rubric criteria

This response does not demonstrate an understanding of the major steps involved in protein synthesis. The student has not identified any of the four major steps accurately. Leaving the nucleus is the beginning of the process, but ""your protein comes in"" is unclear and not specific enough. The steps described after that involve cell division and moving to the membrane, neither of which are key steps in protein synthesis. Additionally, the provided table does not relate the steps in any coherent manner to protein synthesis. The description does not match any of the criteria as per the scoring rubric.
```

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem requires grading a student's response to a question about the four major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus.

## Step 2: Identify key elements of protein synthesis
The key elements of protein synthesis include transcription (mRNA synthesis), translation (initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination), and post-translational modification.

## Step 3: Analyze the student's response
The student's response mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus but then inaccurately describes the subsequent steps, mentioning cell division and proteins moving to the membrane, which are not key steps in protein synthesis.

## Step 4: Compare the response to the scoring rubric
The scoring rubric awards points based on the number of key elements accurately described. Since the student's response does not accurately describe any key elements of protein synthesis beyond mRNA leaving the nucleus and introduces irrelevant steps, it falls under the ""Other"" category.

## Step 5: Determine the rating
Based on the analysis, the response does not meet the criteria for 1, 2, or 3 points, as it does not accurately describe any of the major steps involved in protein synthesis beyond the initial step, which is not enough to qualify for even 1 point.

The answer did not describe any steps involved in protein synthesis, and it contains other information that is irrelevant to the prompt. The task asks students to list and describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis; however, the student response provided unrelated and incorrect information. 

This answer is likely off-task because the student has likely conflated their general understanding of the function of antibodies (perhaps from their own experiences rather than from biology class) with the prompt about protein synthesis (mRNA leaving the nucleus). As such, this answer falls under the 0-point range of the given rubric (""Other"").

The response starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus and describes three major steps: (i) tRNA binding with rRNA (ribosomal RNA), (ii) tRNA coding for new amino acid according to genetic code, and (iii) formation of polypeptide by joining of amino acids. Therefore, the student has mentioned three out of four key elements (major steps) correctly, as expected in the two-point criteria of the scoring rubric. However, the response failed to include the final step of folding and post-translational modification of the protein with complete stoppage to indicate full protein synthesis. The fourth step would be post-translational modification for this process to be considered complete. 

The other problem with the response is the inclusion of some irrelevant pieces of information like a description of the genetic code while missing some more necessary key details of protein synthesis. So, a score of 2 is most suitable because of only three correctly mentioned steps.

# Step 1: Review the scoring rubric to understand the criteria for rating the student's response.
The scoring rubric indicates that the rating should be based on the number of key elements mentioned in the student's response. The ratings range from 0 to 3, with 0 being ""Other"", 1 point for one or two key elements, 2 points for three key elements, and 3 points for four key elements.

# Step 2: Identify the key elements in the student's response.
The student's response mentions the following key elements in the process of protein synthesis: (1) mRNA leaving the nucleus, (2) tRNA binding with rRNA, (3) tRNA coding for the new amino acid, and (4) amino acids joining and creating a protein.

# Step 3: Determine the number of key elements mentioned by the student.
Although the student's response lists four steps, it actually only describes three key elements accurately: tRNA binding with rRNA, tRNA coding for the new amino acid, and amino acids joining to create a protein. The initial mention of mRNA leaving the nucleus is correct but lacks detail, and the response does not adequately address the final step of protein synthesis, which involves folding and post-translational modification.

Please provide reasons in 2-3 sentences why you gave the rating you did in your response. Remember to give feedback by identifying the areas that are lacking or are unclear in the response.

## Step 1: Identify the key elements in the student's response
The student mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus and entering the cytoplasm, being translated by ribosomes into amino acids, and the role of tRNA in reading codons. However, the process described lacks clarity and detail, especially regarding the four major steps involved in protein synthesis.

## Step 2: Analyze the response based on the scoring rubric
Given the information provided, the student touches on the ideas of translation and the involvement of ribosomes and tRNA but fails to clearly outline the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. This includes initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination, which are not explicitly mentioned or described.

## Step 3: Determine the appropriate score based on the analysis

This response earned 0 point with the scoring rubric ""Other"" because the student was unable to accurately identify or describe any of the major steps involved in protein synthesis. None of the key elements required for proper protein synthesis was mentioned in the response. Specifically, the student mistakenly mentioned that mRNA reaches the tRNA and tRNA gives the DNA instructions, whereas, in reality, tRNA reads the sequence of nucleotides on the mRNA, not on the DNA, and translates it into amino acids. Furthermore, the last two steps mentioned, that DNA uses instructions to build genetic code and proteins and enzymes are made, are also inaccurate. Protein synthesis occurs outside the nucleus on ribosomes, and proteins are not directly made from DNA in this step. Overall, the student failed to demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental steps involved in protein synthesis.

No, this would get a 0. In the prompt, it says ""describe four major steps involved in protein synthesis"". The made, carried, and released is part of the description of the three key elements involved in protein synthesis, which would get a 2, not the four steps involved (mRNA translation, mRNA splicing, gene expression, transcription and translation). If that is what it describes, that is where I would get the rationale. So the score would be 0 and the rationale would be  - ""The Student incorrectly described the steps in protein synthesis.""

This response scored a 3 because it presents the four key steps and concepts in translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into a protein, including the roles of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) in reading codons and assembling amino acids. While the response lacks detailed technical accuracy (e.g., not specifying that tRNAs carry the amino acids rather than copying the mRNA to make them), it demonstrates a clear understanding of protein synthesis' broader process. It indicates the involvement of rRNA and tRNA in the translation process, the concept of complementary codons, and the formation of a polypeptide or protein as the end product. Given the rubric's emphasis on listing and describing ""four major steps,"" the essential elements of translation appear to be captured, despite the imprecision in expression.

A score of 0 indicates none or incorrect steps, a score of 1 indicates one or two key elements, a score of 2 indicates three key elements, and a score of 3 indicates all four key elements are correctly listed and described.

## Step 2: Break down the student's response into components to identify key elements.
The student's response mentions mRNA leaving the nucleus and going to the cytoplasm, where it looks for the small subunit of the ribosome, and then describes the translation process as consisting of initiation, elongation, and termination. However, the student incorrectly implies that these three stages are the entirety of protein synthesis, missing the initial step of transcription (though it was not explicitly required since the prompt starts with mRNA leaving the nucleus) and not fully detailing the process.

## Step 3: Evaluate the response against the scoring rubric.
Given the information provided, the student has partially described three stages of protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus: initiation, elongation, and termination. However, the description lacks detail and does not fully address the complexities of these steps. Furthermore, the student has not provided a clear fourth step but has mentioned the necessary environment for translation to occur.

## Step 4: Determine the appropriate score based on the evaluation.
Since the student has identified and partially described three key elements of protein synthesis post-mRNA leaving the nucleus, the response warrants a score of 2, according to the scoring rubric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",2

# Rating


Based on the provided response, I would rate the student's answer as **0**.

## Step 1: Analyzing the response for key elements
The student's response mentions tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA, which are components involved in protein synthesis. However, it lacks a clear and accurate description of the major steps involved in the process.

## Step 2: Identifying inaccuracies and missing steps
The response inaccurately describes the role of rRNA as decoding for mRNA, which is not a correct representation of the process. Additionally, it does not accurately outline the four major steps involved in protein synthesis, such as translation initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination.

## Step 3: Comparing against the scoring rubric
Given the inaccuracies and lack of detail in the response, it does not meet the criteria for 1, 2, or 3 points as outlined in the scoring rubric. The response does not provide a coherent or accurate description of the major steps involved in protein synthesis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",0

Score: 0

This response earns a score of 0, which is classified as ""Other"" on the scoring rubric. The response provided does not accurately identify the four major steps involved in protein synthesis after mRNA leaves the nucleus. Instead, it incorrectly lists terms (nucleotides, ribonucleic, nuclear membrane, and nucleoplasm) that are related to the general process but not specific steps in protein synthesis. The description that follows mixes up concepts of transcription (which occurs before mRNA leaves the nucleus) with those of translation (the actual synthesis of proteins), leading to a confusion of the steps involved in protein synthesis. Overall, the response fails to provide a clear and accurate explanation of the four major steps in protein synthesis as requested.",0

Rationale:
A score of 1 for this response is appropriate because the response indicates that the student is familiar with some of the specialized vocabulary of the field (""translation,"" ""replication"") and may be attempting to apply this vocabulary to a new situation. However, the student response fails to accurately identify or describe in any detail the steps involved in protein synthesis. The student response appears to confuse the different cellular processes and does not provide evidence that the student has an understanding of the four major steps involved in protein synthesis. The response is incomplete, disorganized, and does not make a clear distinction between DNA and RNA processes. This response indicates that the student has a limited understanding of protein synthesis and of the relationships among the processes and components involved.

The student correctly identified three steps in the protein synthesis process. The student described the process of the assembly of polypeptide through translation using the ribosome, rRNA and tRNA. However, the student failed to mention the step of mRNA leaving the nucleus. The student also described the step of folding, which is part of the last stage but missed the step of transcription. Since the student mentioned three correct elements and mentioned one wrong, the score is based on the correct description of three elements.",2
11721,5,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA.

Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.",3," This sequence of events is how proteins are synthesized.

Rating: 3

Rationale: The student has included all four key elements of the major steps in protein synthesis: mRNA entering the cytoplasm (step 1), docking at a ribosome (implied step 2), tRNA reading codons and picking up amino acids (step 3), and the termination with a stop codon and release of the polypeptide chain (step 4).

## Step 1:  Identify the key elements mentioned in the student's response.
The student mentions several key elements involved in protein synthesis, including the ribosome coming to the mRNA strand, the decoding of the strand by two rRNA molecules, the production of a protein on the outside of the ribosome, and the completion of the protein when it reaches the stop codon.

## Step 2:  Match the key elements with the major steps involved in protein synthesis.
The major steps involved in protein synthesis, starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, include translation initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination. The student's response mentions elements that align with initiation (ribosome coming to the mRNA strand), elongation and translocation (decoding and protein production), and termination (completion at the stop codon).

## Step 3:  Apply the scoring rubric based on the identified key elements.
Given that the student's response covers elements that can be matched to the major steps of protein synthesis but does so in a somewhat conflated and simplified manner, it's essential to count how many distinct key elements are clearly described.

## Step 4:  Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
The student clearly describes the ribosome's role, the decoding process, the production of the protein, and the termination at the stop codon. Although the description lacks detail and precision in explaining each step as typically outlined in textbooks (initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination), the essence of a sequence of events leading to protein synthesis is captured.

Let's have fun grading! Thank you so much! Have a wonderful day ahead. 

Your rating followed by a paragraph of rationale will help many students in taking their Biology lessons. Here is your grading moment.

Type your response as the following format:
## Step 1:  Analyze the student's response according to the scoring rubric.
The student's response contains key elements of protein synthesis, including the mRNA leaving the nucleus and carrying instructions to the cytoplasm, the role of transfer RNA in bringing amino acids to the ribosome, the process of amino acids attaching to each other, and the termination of the process when a stop codon is reached.

## Step 2: Identify the major steps described by the student.
The major steps mentioned are: (1) mRNA leaves the nucleus and carries instructions to the cytoplasm, (2) tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome, (3) amino acids attach to each other to form a chain, and (4) the process terminates when a stop codon is reached and the polypeptide chain is formed.

## Step 3: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
Given that the student describes four key elements of protein synthesis that align with the major steps involved in the process, the response should be scored at the top of the rubric scale.

The response contains four major steps in protein synthesis. The student mentions transcription in passing, then translation is correctly described. He refers to mRNA leaving nucleus, and then binding of tRNA on ribosomes; bonding of amino acids to form polypeptide chain; and, finally, the polypeptide chain folding to form a protein. There might be small errors, such as the mention of mRNA being copied from DNA as part of protein synthesis, rather than beforehand, but overall the key elements are correctly described.

(1) Initiation - mRNA leaving the nucleus and heading to a rRNA. 
(2) Translation - The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA, tRNA bringing the amino acid, 
(3)  Amino acids forming an amino acid chain. However, the student merges the process of elongation, translocation, and termination to form broad steps.


Here is another student response:

mRNA molecules are transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. It becomes a long sequence of codons, each containing three nucleotides. A transfer molecule then attaches to the codon and a particular amino acid. An amino acid sequence that is made is essentially a protein. The protein is done when the sequence of nucleotides for a gene has gone all the way through a ribosome. Then the process of protein synthesis is complete.

# Score:

2

Rationale:
The score of 2 is attributed to the student who has partially described the major steps involved in protein synthesis. In the first step, the mRNA actually leaves the nucleus and settles on a ribosome, specifically a small subunit of the ribosome, not the endoplasmic reticulum.  The subsequent step is where the initiation of translation occurs to start protein synthesis, so step 1 description lacks these details and 1 point cannot be given for it. Step 2 is partially correct because it fails to mention the role of the ribosome. Step 3 is the elongation of translation, which is partially correct since it does not describe the process of how amino acids are linked together to form a polypeptide chain using peptide bonds. The fourth major step would include completion of protein synthesis, which might involve translocation and/or describing how the polypeptide chain is released into the cytoplasm, modified,  and becomes a protein or is secreted from the cell. Student’s step 4 and step 5 both only partially complete these ideas. Based on the student’s four statements for steps 1 through 4, one can tell that they cover only 3 key elements because the lack of detail prevents them from being complete major steps.",2

```#[answer]
Based on the response provided, which is assessed against the given rubric that focuses on identifying and describing four major steps in protein synthesis starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, the student response lacks comprehensive detail. However, it does attempt to explain some key steps, though inaccurately and incompletely.


```#[rationale]
2

The student correctly identifies that mRNA leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome, where tRNA matches codons with anti-codons, bringing appropriate amino acids. The mention of amino acids being linked by peptide bonds and the eventual packaging in the endoplasmic reticulum touches on translation and post-translational modification, respectively. However, the description is incomplete regarding the initiation and elongation phases and is somewhat inaccurate, particularly in specifying that amino acids are sent to the ER after 35 are linked, which does not precisely align with how proteins are synthesized or how they move to the ER. The student does not clearly delineate the four major steps.

# Scoring Rationale:

The student has described four key elements involved in protein synthesis. First, the student mentioned mRNA docking into a ribosome to initiate translation. Second, tRNA that matches the mRNA codon attaches to the mRNA, bringing a specific amino acid. Third, the student mentioned amino acids linking together to become a protein. Lastly, the student stated that after being formed, the protein is released. Although not fully detailed, this response contains all four major steps described in the prompt—initiation, translation, elongation, and termination (release of a completed protein).

The rating is 1 because the student only identifies the incorporation of tRNA and pairing with amino acids in protein synthesis but does not describe the translation process thoroughly. Additionally, their response is incomplete, including only two key elements of protein synthesis: transcription and translation. They also seem confused about the process of transcription, where DNA is used to create a complementary RNA molecule, mistakenly attributing the change in nucleotides to tRNA. Therefore, since they only provided two key elements, a score of 1 was awarded. This score may have also been considered because the student didn't identify the actual steps involved, instead, vaguely discussing concepts. So according to the rubric 1 point is awarded when only one or two key elements are present.```",1

Another important step in the process is helical shape where the polypeptide chain goes into a spiral shape as it forms hydrogen bonds.


# Rating: 


# Rationale:


# Response:

I don't see four major steps or even three. I see 2: translation (including initiation and elongation) where the polypeptide chain is created, and possibly termination, and tertiary structure formation. As per the rubric, mentioning 3 key elements scores a 2, and 1 or 2 key elements scores 1. Since the student described 2 major steps accurately, I would rate this response with a score of **1**.

Rationale: The response is missing the step of initiation and termination for translation (where the ribosome and mrna set up and leave after translation) and does not accurately convey the concept of helical shape as one specific step in protein structure formation, namely secondary structure. Also, the initiation and elongation steps in translation do not come out as distinct major steps either, but as a single translation step with two components. Thus, the response does not clearly break down the major steps in protein synthesis but instead confuses and combines them. Also, the student describes 'helical shape' without clearly specifying where it belongs as a major step in protein structure formation, and seems to refer to the overall structure of the polypeptide chain. It appears like the student knows there is something about protein structure formation beyond making the peptide chains but does not effectively articulate the concepts.

# Answer:

2 

The response provided by the student lists and describes, in a somewhat confusing way, three key elements in the process of protein synthesis, including:

1. mRNA binding to the ribosome to initiate translation, correctly mentioning codons.
2. tRNA's role in bringing amino acids to the ribosome and matching them to codons with their anticodons, though somewhat inaccurately described as tRNA ""lining up its anitcodons with the codons.""
3. The process of forming a peptide bond between amino acids to create a protein chain, noting its dependence on the arrangement of amino acids for its function.

However, the student's description of the third element, involving the movement of RNA and the release of bases, seems to mix up elements of transcription and translation and is not accurately describing a major step in protein synthesis as it relates to mRNA translation at the ribosome.

Moreover, key elements like initiation (specifically how translation starts with the first amino acid), elongation (the continuous addition of amino acids, correctly matched by tRNA), or termination (how translation ends) are missing or inaccurately represented.

Therefore, the student gets a 2 for identifying and somewhat describing three key elements of the process, albeit with inaccuracies.",2

# Rating and Rationale

Rating: 2

The student response mentions three key elements in the protein synthesis: the role of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in protein synthesis, the attachment of amino acids to tRNA, and their combination to form a polypeptide chain until a STOP codon is encountered. However, the response lacks one key element—initiation, elongation, and termination are not discussed with enough detail to consider each as separate steps. Moreover, translation process is oversimplified.
