It may also mean taking over.",0," The reptiles that Maclnnes talks about are the ""invasive species"" that can invade Florida or other parts of the country and hurt the people who keep them as pets and can also hurt the other species.
 
Maclnnes says animals should be reffered to as ""introduced"" not invasive because that is a fair word so Maclnnes believes the reptiles are not invasive they are even helping the ecosystem however, biologists say that it is invasive because they have no control if one of these pet reptiles can go wild and hurt everyone, which happened on an example in the text. There are animals being killed and endangered and one example is the Key Largo wood rat which are being killed and even swallowed by these burmese pythons. In conclusion, the word ""invasive"" can be very important because it can decide wether or not animals should be kept free.

The author suggests that invasive species can be life threatening to other species that are native to the places they're invading. These animals have no natural predators, meaning that their population will continuously grow. The author talks about how these species are introduced. This is shown when he says that Maclnnes says the animals are being ""introduced"" to these new ecosystems, and that he likes to say that it is not that they are ""invasive"". Also in paragraph 11, it says that the term ""invasive"" has its meaning in that it says the animal is not just harmless, meaning that these animals can be destructive.

This response demonstrates a simplistic and superficial understanding of the term ""invasive"" and its significance in the article. The student's definition of ""invasive"" as something that disrupts the ecosystem when introduced is correct, but they fail to delve deeper into the implications and complexities of the term. They also seem to downplay the negative impact of invasive species on the ecosystem, suggesting that it can ""bring new changes"" and ""allow more adaptations to occur.""

For one thing, the USGS map says the habitat for the snakes can be a third of the continental United States even California to Delaware. Since the article talks about the alligators having pythons in their mouths this would change the ecosystems. It brings the python and other animals more problems.

Let me know what I can do to make the response better. 

The response is Scored: 1


The student attempts to explain the term ""invasive"" within the context of the passage showing its significance in the rest of the article. The student goes beyond the definition of invasive and explores its implications on the ecosystems as a result of the invasion. Additionally, in the student's opinion, the author presents alternative perspectives, such as Maclnnes calling it ""introduced"". Despite providing sufficient enough evidence and information from the article, the student did little to demonstrate explicit and implicit information evaluation, and therefore only achieved a score of 1.

What are some other things that the student can do to enhance and score higher? Here are a few suggestions. The student could incorporate more details from the passage such as explicit details about the consequences of the invasion such as the python exploding after consuming the alligator and the decline of a certain species population and providing more explanation and evidence for claims. An example is the claim that certain species population will decrease. How does the ""invasion"" cause the population to decline? In terms of sentence structure and grammar, certain sentences tend to be simplistic. Consider varying sentence structures or word choices. Incorporating transitions can be extremely helpful as well. The student response seems a bit too simplistic at times. Lastly, in terms of analysis, what insights can the student infer about the perspectives on this topic? 

For instance, the fact that different people consider invasive species to mean different things - some look at it purely from an ecological perspective while others attach emotional connotations. By doing so, the student should be able to elevate their writing sample and achieve a higher score of 2.",1
8699,4,Invasive is very significant to this article.

9309,4,The word "invasive" is significant to the article because it is coming in and invading places where it shouldn't be. "Invasive is passing judgement"(4).

RobRoy says he is not making a problem but scientists do when it comes from species and have no predators and they also make a good species. Invasive animals like the cobra can hurt people or cause danger like the snake and it would be good to know if its going to hurt you. That is significant because the article is talking with respect.

I see several things in the article of both point of view, including what the owner thinks about species and what the scientists think. I believe RobRoy is giving his own perspective, I agree that invasive is passing judgement. Its significant because there isn't anyone who will do anything about that the man is going to keep the animals for 100 dollars even though it might hurt people like it did to that man's pet. For respect, we should respect what the article said.

## Step 1: Evaluate the student's understanding of the significance of the word ""invasive"".
The student attempts to explain the significance of the word ""invasive"" but provides a somewhat superficial and vague definition, stating that it is ""coming in and invading places where it shouldn't be.""

## Step 2: Assess the student's ability to support their response with information from the article.
The student references quotes from the article, such as ""Invasive is passing judgement"" and ""they are major threats to biodiversity,"" but the connections to the significance of the word ""invasive"" are not clearly explained.

## Step 3: Consider the student's ability to evaluate explicit and implicit information and make judgments about the text.
The student makes some attempt to consider multiple perspectives, including RobRoy's and the scientists', but the analysis is limited and lacks depth.

## Step 4: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.

8464,4,"In the article ""One Man's Pet, Another's Invasive species"", they use invasive to explaine how some animals are a threat to biodiversity. MacInnes, stated that he thinks people judge the species forlex, pythons.

He says pythons are not a bad thing, and thinks the everglades is a better place with them. The government is putting restrcitions on certien speices because of there dangers. 

The significance of the word ""invasive,"" in this article is to explaine how animals and speices can be of harm when not in there right enviorment. The word ""invasive"" makes the reader look at the animals and speices as ""introduced,"" to another enviorment and consider if it is harming it or not. The word ""invasive"" does not just mean harm. Sometimes invasive speices can be a threat or harm but also improve. 

The word invasive in a lot of way makes you wonder who or what decided if one speices is invasive. In Florida the goverment created a law that can determine what speices are invasive. The word ""invasive"" makes the reader relize that animals speices, and organisms can also be looked at diffrently when placed in diffrent enviorments.
The word ""invasive"" is important to the article because it has different meanings for different people, showing whether people see introduced speices as a harm, threat, positive, or negative impact to enviorment. 

Therefore, the significance of the word invasive in the article ""One Man's Pet, Another's Invasive species"", shows the impact that introduced speices can have on biodiversity, and how people can have different opinions on what is invasive.

This response deserves a score of 0 according to the scoring rubric. The response only exhibits a cursory analysis of the test. For instance, the author says the pet shop owner believes invasive species are good for the environment without giving further context from the text. The student also fails to assess explicit and implicit information in the text as required from the higher scores from the rubric. The response uses simplistic sentences, lacking more insight and a clear perspective making it deserve the score of 0.",0
8444,4,The significance of the word "invasive" to the article is that it shows what these reptiles are doing by coming to America. They are coming and invading areas like the Everglades and Cape coral by breeding and raising their population. Additionally "invasive" shows an opinion of the snakes because they could be known to be introduced instead of invaded.,1," 

This point is shown by a quote from Rob Roy, ""Even the term ""invasive species is unfair, "" he said. ""They're 'introduced.' I think that 'invasive' is passing judgment. Another man states. This shows that invasive may not be the best word because it does make you pass judgment which makes you opinionated. This shows  that by saying invasive we are making the animals seem bad instead of looking at them neutrally. The word invasive makes us react negative instead of neutral. Robroy prefers ""introduced"" because it doesn't pass that same judgment as ""invasive."" 

This word is also significant because it shows what many biologists are trying to say which is that we do not need these reptiles because they may kill the other animals in the Everglades and disrupt the ecosystems. This word is one main reason that Florida placed a law on buying any monitor lizard or large snakes including pythons. To prevent them from being ""invasive"". 

They are worried about these reptiles because when anything can go anywhere complications ensue. This shows that biologists think that ""invasive"" is more negative. This further proves that biologists do not prefer invasive species in America, specifically the reptiles that are being talked about because they worry that they will mess with the ecosystems.

So the overall significance of the word invasive in this article is that it has a negative look on the reptiles coming to America and causing issues in the Everglades and other areas. This further states what we should do to stop them because biologists do not approve. 

The author used this word to have a better understanding about invasive species and their effect on America's ecosystems.

The test-taker provides some evidence from the passage that demonstrates the significance of invasive species, such as how invasive species affect biodiversity and are major threats to the environment. The test-taker also explains how the species can potentially affect humans. However, the test-taker's analysis does not fully address the text and does not move beyond the boundaries of the text. The test-taker simply provides a basic outline of what invasive species are and how they have an influence on the native environment. Additionally, the test-taker does not address how the term ""invasive"" is seen as ""unfair"" or ""passing judgement"" by some, such as RobRoy Maclnnes.

Explain the significance of the word “invasive” to the rest of the article. Support your response with information from the article.

Student Response: 

The word invasive is very important  and this word is not being used here for no reason because the snake was eating everything and  becoming stronger by eating each and every small animal",1
9195,4,The significance of the word "invasive" is that the pythons and other reptiles that are being imported are slowly taking over the areas that they are inhabiting. They are killing off native species and are invading the habitats.,2," The word ""invasive"" has a negative connotation, because it is stating the negative impacts these reptiles are having on the area. The article tells us that RobRoy Maclnnes thinks the word ""invasive"" is unfair and thinks that a more appropriate word would be ""introduced"". However, others, like the US Fish and Wildlife Service, view these reptiles as a real threat and think that they can harm biodiversity. The word ""invasive"" is a term used to describe species that are not native to their habitat and are becoming a problem for native species. They are not just a species that is being introduced to a new area but they are causing damage and taking over. The word ""invasive"" is significant, because it is used to show the impact these reptiles are having on the natural habitats. The word ""introduced"" would not convey the same meaning, because it would just say the reptiles were brought in, but would not convey what is happening, once the reptiles are there. 

For example, according to the article, the Burmese python has become a huge problem in the Everglades. The snakes are killing off the native species in the Everglades and are becoming a huge concern. The article says that Skip Snow pulled hundreds of pythons out of the Everglades. These pythons are a huge threat to biodiversity and are going to continue to be a major problem if something does not change. The article also talks about how the Burmese python even ate an alligator, which exploded in its stomach. This example illustrates the devastating impact these snakes are having on the Everglades. The word ""invasive"" is used to convey the negative impacts that these snakes are having and the consequences of what is going to happen if something does not get done about it.

Rationale: The response demonstrates a thoughtful examination of the word “invasive” and its significance throughout the article. By describing the negative connotation and the negative impacts of the invasive species on native species and habitats, the student provides explicit information that demonstrates an understanding of the word in the context of the article. By showing how some characters, such as Maclnnes, disagree with the use of “invasive,” while others agree with it, the student demonstrates the ability to evaluate information in the article. The student also demonstrates the ability to use the article to project the implications raised by the word, giving specific examples such as the pythons killing",2
8605,4,The word invasive is significant to the story because it describes the animals that one unchecked by natural predator and one maybe threats to biodiversity.,1," In the article, we see that RobRoy Maclnnes calls the term” invasive species” ”unfair” because he sees it as passing judgement. RobRoy Maclnnes thinks that the creatures are “introduced” not invasive. Maclnnes said:  “To me it’s a wonderful introduction. I think it’s the best thing to happen to the Everglades in the last 200 years.” In a lot of ways the way you use the word invasive can really have a lot of meaning. As an example, Skip Snow a wildlife biologist said,  “The snakes, he says, are imperiling five endangered species in the Florida Keys, including the Key Largo wood rat, one specimen of which, tagged with a radio transmitter, was tracked all the way to the belly of a python. This means that the word invasive could affect people opinion on the subject.  “When was the last snake story that didn’t get sensationalized?”

# Rationale
In this response, the candidate provides explicit information regarding the significant word “invasive” to further understand the story about the topic from the article using explicit information about what Maclnnes thinks about the word invasive. Although the candidate provides information about the word invasive, a superficial view was seen throughout the response since they only stated what the article says regarding the word invasive and they did not show how this information was relevant, meaningful, or critical for evaluating the text. In addition, candidate did not explicitly show how to move past the boundary of the text (the text boundary being showing and telling what is discussed about the word invasive). In addition, they did not make insightful judgments about the text because in the statement, they stated “This means that the word invasive could affect people opinion on the subject.” This does not make insightful judgments but instead is showing an oversimplification.",1
8310,4,Invasive was used in the story as in a meaningful word. They repeated it several times.,0," By calling the reptile invasive they wanted that it had an negative impact on the wildlife. Biologists said that non-native creatures are a menace to the environment and is the primary threat to biodiversity. They think the pet trade is to blame for what happen for the pythons in the Everglades.

They said that humans is doing most of the invasions. Like on what the biologists say about life the Earth. The government was mad at the lizard and snakes because they are invading species. By this the biologist and the government wants to put emphasis and inform the people that invading the species cause many problems, the government even create a law that you should get the $100 annual permit and should also include a microchip for you to buy them.

The thing with invasive is that they like to do with their habitat is they like to be with what their habitats have. This only shows that the reptile that is an invading specie don’t want to be with the humans. That is the only that we can take out of it.

However, most invasive species can adapt to many different habitats, and can live in a wide variety of conditions. In fact, a map shows most of the U.S as a possible habitat for pythons.
But animals such as lizards and snakes tend, at least in this culture, to be less well-respected or supported. For example with what Skip Snow say. They are the species that can thrive in many condition and cause problems that is why invasive was used on the article.

The quote is correctly attributed to Maclnnes but lacks his name; however, the student's response lacks sufficient analysis of the significance of the word ""invasive"". The student's response includes some of the correct terms and tries to provide examples from the figure provided. Nevertheless, the student response is incomplete with little or no evaluation of implicit or explicit information in the text and thus demonstrates a ""cursory examination of the text"" in the scoring rubric. Some sentences seem not logical; for example,  ""For instance, In the figure 1 map, most reptiles are in the southern part of the US."" which is a simplistic projection of implications of the word ""invasive"" in article and is an illogical explanation to the prompt question.

8624,4,"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the article because the article mentions how the Burmese python is an example of an invasive species, this means the species can invade and adapt to a non-native habitat just like the pythons have been increasing in the Everglades, Florida.",2," As a result of invasive species, biologists argue they are an important threat to biodiversity and there can be complications in the ecosystem if natural barriers are broken. 

Therefore, the author does not only describe pets and their behavior but also implies there is a bigger threat by invasive species and how they can lead to a big issue for the US if they spread. 

However, the term “invasive species” is opposed by Maclnnes because he does not think they pose a significant threat to biodiversity but the introduction of a non-native species has brought complications in some US habitats. The use of the word “invasive” gives a negative point of view against the exotic pet trade in the article because of the results it might bring; which is a negative effect on biodiversity. The word ""invasive"" also adds emotions in the readers against the exotic pet trade because it gives a sense of discomfort and threat to the original ecosystem.

8625,4,I think the word invasive is very significant to this article. I think this because in the article it uses invasive to explain how the pythons have started to take over the Evergreens.,1," This is an example of the explicit information that the article gave in the article. “But biologists see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species, such as the Burmese python,” (Achenbach ). This quote shows how when the snakes were taking over, they used the word invasive to demonstrate it is a bad thing for nature and the environment. The author is using invasive in this passage to bring up the issue of animals not originally from this habitat coming in and being very successful. And being bad for the creatures that originally were there. This article I believe is more toward people that like wildlife and maybe even conservationists, since the author brings up concerns about the pythons being in the Everglades. A group I have is not sure how the pythons got into the Everglades because no matter how the people try to find out, they can’t seem to figure out how it happened or “No one knows how the snakes went native, but there’s speculation that Hurricane Andrew,” (Achenbach).

Rationale: The student response is good enough, though the student only examines the text sufficiently on the surface level to justify the author’s use of the word “invasive.” The student tries to move beyond the text’s boundaries by explaining what the author means by using “invasive.” However, they could have tried harder to develop their explanation of the word’s significance by using additional evidence from the text.

Maclnnes feels it is all about perspective, and that an animal could be harmless if it was treated right or cared for in the proper context. However, there are a lot more species of lizards like the python that thrive in warm weather. The author uses the idea of perspective-taking as a literary device to enhance our understanding of what the term invasive means to different groups of people. To scientists and biologists the invasive species are the animals that take away the stability of the ecosystem. To Maclnnes invasive species are the humans themselves who are responsible for global warming and also introduce other species to their respective new homes. He also emphasizes the importance of recognizing both parts of a conflict.

The text states, ""No one knows how the snakes went native, but there's speculation that Hurricane Andrew, which obliterated thousands of homes, played a factor in a wholesale python jailbreak in 1992. Many invasive species undergo a lag before proliferating."" Therefore, invasive means not originally meant to be there or originally there.

In an interview, RobRoy Maclen, a snake enthusiast told Joel Achenbach, that the term ""invasive speices"" shouldn't be used, instead, it should be ""introduced"".  The reason he said this is he believes snakes shouldn't be referred to as a threat to certain areas like as in his neighborhood they are referred to as pets that people love and care for. That being said, the word ""invasive speicies"" is oftenly used to show a particular specie, or specie's is, or are harming a certain area.

Rationale: In the response provided, the student touches upon the significance of the term “invasive” in relation to the article, offering a definition and an example to reinforce their point. They mention that the exotic animals are not indigenous to the US and, while adapting, they put native and endangered species in harm. The example given about snakes in the Everglades eating up endangered species is relevant, showing an understanding of the text’s context. The response partially evaluates the implications of invasive species as presented in the article, demonstrating some ability to engage with the topic beyond the surface level.

# Rationale:

The response demonstrates a cursory examination of the text. The student's explanation of the significance of the word ""invasive"" relies on partial quotes that seem to be plucked randomly from the text without much consideration of the broader context or meaning. For instance, the quote ""The significance of the word 'invasive' is passing judgment"" is taken from a statement made by RobRoy Maclnnes, but the student does not critically evaluate this claim or consider alternative perspectives, such as those of biologists who see invasive species as a major threat to biodiversity. The response also contains simplistic and vague information, including the unexpanded claim that ""organisms that evolve natural barriers is removed,"" which lacks clarity and relevance to the topic at hand. Overall, the response fails to provide a thoughtful and thorough examination of the text, and thus, earns a score of 0.",0
8797,4,The significaren in the word invasive is their introduced.

This is the meaning of invasive. Because, these animals are really important to our ecosystem, we need them and we are the people introducing all the animals. 

In these two sentences - I think invasive species is when something is a snake or a lizard or a turtle it does not mean like its the invader. To me, invasive species sounds the like species is invading our earth. Even when we are the ones who brought them there. 

Also, like, invasive species is like a scientific thing, where we try to figure out why and how these animals come in and where they live now. To call them invasive is to pass judgement because some species were able to expand the ecosystem. So for the term invasive, it's just really a label on the species that are introduced. These specie is introduced to us by human. And we are calling these animals invasive! So its us human who did this!

However, biologists claim that ""invasive species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."" The biologists have a valid argument and they are worried about the outcome of the species being released or escaped into the wild.

Reptiles being invasive can cause major issues such as snakes eating endangered species. For example, in paragraph 7, Snakes are killing endangered species in the Florida Keys. Some of the species that get hurt are the Key Largo wood rat. Snakes that were thought to be extinct are turning up alive in places such as the Florida Keys. So the word ""invasive"" refers to the species that are coming into our country, and eating other animals that can not defend themselves.

# Rating and Rationale:

The student generally uses information from the text to address the prompt and provides supporting details that demonstrate some understanding of the significance of the word “invasive” to the article. The student identifies a range of viewpoints on the term “invasive” by noting that MacInnes thinks the term is unfair and that it passes judgment on reptiles and biologists think that it accurately represents the threats posed to biodiversity. The student supports this understanding by referencing specific events described in the text (e.g., that snakes are eating endangered species in the Florida Keys, including the Key Largo wood rat). While the student provides a reasonable response, the answer suffers from an inability to move beyond the information provided in the text: the student mostly paraphrases the text, and the discussion doesn’t provide a very nuanced or thoughtful analysis of the implications or connotations of the term “invasive.” The student also could have provided more context regarding why the concept of invasive species is an important aspect of conservation biology. Some sentences are poorly written (e.g., “By changing the word to ‘introduced’ the idea of bad changes to neutral.”). Overall, this response would fall in the “1” range of the scoring rubric, demonstrating limited examination of the text and some (but not complete) understanding of the prompt.

The student's analysis of the word ""invasive"" is thoughtful and well-supported by textual evidence. The student correctly identifies that the word ""invasive"" carries negative connotations and implies that something is harmful or unwanted, and that this term is often used by biologists and the U.S. Wildlife Service to describe non-native species that are seen as a threat. The student also notes that the word ""invasive"" is not just a neutral description of an animal's origin, but also implies a judgment about the animal's impact on the environment. The student's recognition of the complexity of the term ""invasive"" and its connotations is insightful and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the text. Additionally, the student provides examples from the text, such as the quote from Jamie K.

The student understands that the word “invasive” is used to describe the dangers posed by non-native reptiles. This is demonstrated in the opening sentence where the student makes this link explicit. However, the explanation of why the animals are “invasive” is not well supported and relies largely on simple quotes from the article. The first quote from page 9 demonstrates an understanding of how invasive species, left unchecked by natural predators, harm biodiversity, but the student does not elaborate on this point, failing to examine all explicit and implicit information. The second quote on page 6 is incorrectly applied, since it is saying how reptiles were brought into the habitat, not out into the wild.

This makes pythons sound, like harmful creatures which is how the author is trying to use the word invasive so it will seem bad so that humans can get rid of them. 

This is also evident on page two because one of the biologists is trying to make it seem if this is all the pythons fault in this article he is blaming the problem on them in order to get support for getting rid of them which to him is invasive species. 

The author also says these invasive species come from humans which can mean that invasive species can also be things we humans don't need or that harm us from around the us. I see this in the text where they say that this is part of an experiment and humans are at fault for letting them free because they are changing animals' habitats.

Overall the word invasive to the author in this story means something bad that we don't need here and we need to get rid of. And that's only because they’re going to hurt us or we don't need them here on earth.

The student gives a brief examination of the concept of ""invasive"" in the article and relates it to the views held by MacInnes and the biologists. The response notes the potential for controversy but could have further explored the significance of invasive species as a threat to biodiversity, as mentioned in the article. While the response attempts to consider multiple perspectives, it does not offer a thorough evaluation of the explicit and implicit information in the text.",1

# Step 1:  Identify the rubric requirements to determine the score
The scoring rubric requires the response to demonstrate a level of examination of the text, consideration of how, why, or for whom the text was written, ability to evaluate explicit and implicit information, and making judgments about the text. A score of 0 represents a cursory examination with little consideration and evaluation, a score of 1 shows a sufficient but limited examination with some consideration and evaluation, and a score of 2 demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough examination with an ability to evaluate and make insightful judgments.

# Step 2:  Examine the student's response based on the rubric requirements
The student's response attempts to define the term ""invasive"" but does so in a very superficial manner, merely equating it to ""threatening"" without further exploration of the text. The response also fails to consider the broader implications of invasive species and the author's perspective on the issue. The use of the term ""threating"" and the limited analysis indicate a lack of depth in understanding the significance of the word ""invasive"" within the context of the article. Furthermore, the conclusion ""I do not think I would want a 10 ft snake in my community"" is an opinion that does not significantly add to the explanation of the term ""invasive.""

# Step 3:  Determine the score based on the analysis
Given the superficial analysis and the failure to engage with the text beyond a basic level, the response aligns most closely with the criteria for a score of 0. The response demonstrates a cursory examination of the text, does not move beyond the boundaries of the text, shows little consideration of how, why, or for whom the text was written, and makes superficial judgments.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",0

They also put a microchip in the animals in case they go out of their habitat and make a mess.
It also shows that the word invasive doesn't only affect the environment but also has an impact in human's economy. According to the text, it is expensive to take care of the invasive species and also to keep them from being brought to the country. By adding restrictions they are limiting the growth of the reptile business which can be problematic to the economy. In my opinion scientists are doing the right thing to protect the ecosystem but it also affects people who like these animals such as Maclnnes.

In this question, the student is asked to explain the significance of the word ""invasive."" This response demonstrates a very basic understanding of the term invasive. Furthermore, the student focuses on just one person, RobRoy Maclnnes, and only considers the concept of the term invasive from his perspective. This response doesn't provide a proper evaluation of how and why the author presents the term invasive. It also doesn't assess the significance of the word in the entire passage. The information provided for understanding invasive is superficial. This response only mentions that ""invasive"" means ""dangerous"" without elaborating how the term helps create meaning in the passage.

# Rating: 1

The student recognized the significance of the word ""invasive"" to be a debateable subject and provided evidence from the passage to support their claim, including that MacInnes argues that it is ""passing judgement"" and that biologists think that invasive species are major threats to biodiversity. In addition, the student cited evidence from the passage that biologists disagree with MacInnes's perspective that invasive species are simply ""introduced."" Therefore, the response demonstrates sufficient, though limited, understanding of the subject because it mainly focuses on the two different perspectives of the term ""invasive,"" and uses direct quotes from the passage. The student's response would have been stronger if it has discussed how the term ""invasive"" relates to the broader themes of the passage, such as the impact of invasive species on the ecosystem.

The response demonstrates a cursory examination of the text, does not move beyond the boundaries of the text, and shows little ability to evaluate explicit and implicit information. The response makes superficial judgments about the text, stating that invasive species ""are dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to occur."" The language is simplistic, and the response fails to provide evidence from the article to support its claims. Additionally, the response contains grammatical errors and lacks clarity, indicating a limited understanding of the text.",0
9233,4,I think that 'Invasive' is passing judgement.,0,"  It is not neutral and this shows the way the species is being perceived as a threat. Biologists and people that are not in favor of these reptiles will call them invasive because it has been determined that they pose a threat to the environment and wildlife. But others, like the owner of the reptile store, will downplay this term.
In the article, Maclnnes claims that the term ""Invasive"" is biased. Invasive means that the species should not be there; however, from the perspective of some, such as store owners, these species are just what the ecosystem needs. Maclnnes claims the pythons “...are the best thing to happen to the Everglades in the last 200 years“ and thus calling them invasive would be an opposing point, which is more than just a word choice.  
By contrast, Skip Snow who is a wildlife biologist at Everglades National Park points to the fact that pythons can cause other species to become extinct. This goes on to show how the use of the word “Invasive” portrays a negative image which has a large impact not only on the environment but on the species themselves. 

The significance of the word “invasive” is further supported by the fact that  the biologist Skip Snow sees a python as a threat, whereas to the store owner, it is an opportunity. This shows that the terms invasive and “introduced” to some extent, has a level of bias to it. There is an underlying negative tone, which is carried throughout the article.


In conclusion, the word Invasive to a large extent does give biased judgment about a species depending on who and what perspective a individual is looking at it from. Depending who we are, we tend to choose terms which express our views and opinions and hence the significance of the word. The term “Invasive” was first introduced from an environmental point of view as it gave a view to the harmful effects of a species towards the environment. The impact was then later found out to be negative on both the ecosystem and to other species itself.

This text demonstrates significant analysis of the term ""invasive"" throughout the article. It uses a number of facts and arguments put forward by various individuals, such as Maclnnes and Skip Snow, to demonstrate the multiple perspectives on invasive species.

But in the artical, it states that most of the reptiles in the U.S were introduced into the US so they are not invasive.",1," ""They're introduced. I think that invasive is passing judgment""  said RobRoy Maclnnes. So ""invasive"" is more of a label put on reptiles due to fear of human saftey. I understand why the auther would agree with this. Humans do destroy habitats and the invasive speices  like pythones for example will take over the animal population who are native. Since 1992 when Hurrican andrew took place many python went free and now we see reptiles in the wild. Invasive speices tend to generalist beacuse humans are continusly destorying this earth and the population of reptiles are just going increase. Tha's all it is.

But most people know that reptiles have done no good for us which is why they don't want them. Some people may get scared of they get released. But like Achenbach states the species that are invasive to one may be introduced by another. For instacne the python has been introduced into the Everglades by hurricanes or by people releasing it into wild. Many animals have already died like alligator that had a python in their stomach which had exploded because the python had eaten the aligator and took all its space in stomach. Many animals such as snails and rat are dying because of the python. So based on the artcle inavise means something harmful or dangeous.

In the article, the word ""invasive"" refers to a species that is not native to a particular environment, but is able to survive and thrive there, often at the expense of native species. The student response accurately conveys this understanding, and provides an example of an invasive species (the Burmese python) and its impact on native species (the Key Largo wood rat).

The student states that the significance of the word ""invasive"" is ""to fully invade and take over,"" but they provide no evidence from the text to support this claim other than surface details (e.g., pythons were seen in multiple locations, they are growing in size and are taking over). They do not provide any evaluation of the implications of the word ""invasive"" in the context of the text, and their conclusion is too simplistic and unsophisticated. Specifically, the word “invasive” means that species introduced by humans are taking over natural ecosystems. The student does not mention this key concept in their response and therefore demonstrates a cursory examination of the text. Additionally, they do not address the author’s reason for presenting these ideas and how the word “invasive” relates to these ideas (e.g., the destruction of natural habitats for native species).

Although the response makes an attempt to address the issue by acknowledging that invasive species, like the Burmese pythons, have spread to the Everglades, the effort is not thorough.  While the student recognizes invasive species to be harmful, the student does not clearly relate the significance of the term ""invasive"" and does not use evidence from the text to support their claim. Additionally, the student provides illogical information (""Biologist said in a few years it’s going to be up the whole state of Florida"") which is not supported by the text.

8340,4,"The word ""invasive"" in this article is stating something, whether it being a food source or predetor, that conflicts with the life or environment of another species or habitat.",1," The significance of this term is because in this article one man is making money off another's invasive species like snakes, crocodiles, scorpions, and etc. He says that the term ""invasive"" is unneccesary, even though in the case of the python. He believes that it is natural in the Everglades and people should just let it be. But, a wildlife biologist, Skip Snow believes that invasive species like the python are a threat to the ecosystem. Which means that the python could wipe out the local species, like the Key Largo wood rat, in which the biologist says is in a dangerous position and could go extinct if the python is not controlled.

In my own opinion that is why they have so strict rules over buying species that could be invasive. This is where a lot of the problems start. So many animals have been taken out of their natural habitat to become pets, that have later been abandoned or released that have harmed the ecosystem. Just to make a profit, the man is not concerned about this, only on making a profit, this is why the term ""invasive"" has so much meaning to this article. Another species could push the other species out of its natural habitat. This is why it is also so dangerous to introduce species to unknown lands, which could disrupt the foodchain or disrupt the ecosystem.

9633,4,The significance of the word invasive means that reptile pets are becoming more popular and invading the homes of their owners.,0," It has been estimated that almost 5 million homes in the world have a reptile. This number has risen by nearly 100% in the last few decades. However, the owners must apply for a permit that costs $100 annually and have the reptile implanted with a microchip. The cost of these pets has grown rapidly, particularly the cost of a cobra, reaching up to $600.

The word ""invasive"" is used by biologists to characterize species that are harmful to the natural ecosystem. This term helps to create a negative feeling towards invasive species, especially reptiles. When animals are left unchecked in the wild, they may not be able to survive, due to a lack of natural predators. There is a danger to native species when the ecosystem is affected as in the Everglades, where five endangered species are vulnerable to attacks by Burmese pythons.

Rationale: The answer provides a simple explanation and does not fully analyze the meaning or significance of the word ""invasive"". It starts off by describing how reptiles are becoming more popular pets. This statement, and the rest of the paragraph, fails to understand and relate the key term ""invasive"" as a characteristic of species threatening the natural habitat in consideration from the given context. However, the following paragraph shows a somewhat clearer understanding by stating the significance of the word ""invasive"" in terms of describing species that harm the natural ecosystem. The explanation is clear. The description given, though not perfect, demonstrates some ability to evaluate explicit information, and makes plausible judgments about the information, which does not fully correspond to a zero rating. Thus, one mark out of two is given.",1
9190,4,"The word invasive means to intrude or to unwelcome. This word is significant to this article because in many ways biologists argue these reptiles are very much invasive. Paragraph 11 quotes ""hundreds of Burmese pythons have been discored out of weeds, off road ways and even under the hood of a tourist's car.",1," Another words these pythons have invaded the territory in more ways then one. Biologists, in paragraph 13 also state that they are eating species in danger. For example of them hunting the ""key largo wood rat"" and tracked a rat being eaten by a python. 

This is not just in Florida Keys also in other places even outside of their habitat. In Figure 1 most of the habitat of the pythons is in the southern part of the US. Many of them are also located in California through Delaware. The Burmese pythons in this story have invaded in places where it is not their territory for them to settle in. And even the humans are not happy about having the pythons come to their territory. If you look at paragraph 6, you will see a quote ""That tag could help officals identify the animal if it turns up later in the wild."" Officals have to put a special tag on the reptile in order to keep tract on them.

Many people are trying to avoid the reptiles. In paragraph 21 it is quoted ""ecophobia is playing a role."" The term invasion is not favored by the owner of ""Glades Herp Farma"" who is the co-owner RobRoy Maclnnes. He believes that the reptiles were not invading they are just introduced. Even though biologists say that the reptiles are invasive species.

I would personally say that it is more than just the meaning of a word and with it, comes a story of invasion.

I know this because the whole article is mainly about reptiles.,0," The word invasive means a species is in the area and it doesn’t belong. It’s hurting the environment because these species don’t have natural predators so they are out of control. When the government wants to block or make it harder for someone to buy reptiles that are invasive or “toxic” they are trying to be proactive, but reptile owners don’t think that it’s fair because they feel that it’s their rights and that what they have is not bad or harmful. Even though the owner said the word invasive is just a word, we can tell that it means a species that is being hurtful to the environment and to other people who lives around there or is not respectful of other species.

He even said those reptiles will protect the environment. This is different from the view of the scientists. They see the reptiles as invasive since they are harming the Florida Keys and its animals. Biologists like Skip Snow really disagree with Maclnnes's idea. They think the reptiles are a threat to other animals, and will continue to do so if they are not stopped. Both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the scientists want to block Maclnnes from importing more reptiles. They need to stop the importation of these animals to save the environment. The environment is in danger, but some people are too selfish to care. The state now needs a new law, which is for buyers to get a 100 dollar permit which can be used to keep track of a reptile if it escapes. The term invasive species will continue to be used in the story with more and more facts that are being discovered about these reptiles.

8478,4,Invasive is important word because that is what the artical circles around was the python invasive or was it pertosly inter dosed.,1," invasive means it was harmfull or is hurting other species which in this the artical is sayign that pythons are eating small animales native to the everglades like endangered wood rat.



Score: 0

The response shows limited examination of the article and understanding of the word ""invasive."" The support given for the significance of ""invasive"" in the article (""the python invasive or was it pertosly inter dosed"") demonstrates a cursory understanding of the central ideas in the article. The response also fails to recognize that the term ""invasive"" is a key point of contention between the article's main subjects (Maclnnes and Snow), and that it relates to the discussion of biodiversity and ecological disruption more generally, rather than solely the impact on small animals native to the Everglades. Instead of considering the range of arguments and ideas presented about invasive species in the article, the response relies on incomplete and vague statements (e.g., ""harmfull or is hurting other species""). Overall, the student's failure to adequately support their claims about the significance of ""invasive"" and their shallow engagement with the article's content align with the criteria for a score of 0.",0
9560,4,"""invasive"" means animals that came from other places, in which they are different from what were use to because they didn't came from here for example; The U.S fish and wildlife service have blocked MacInnes from from importing some commercially attractive animals from importing some commercially attractive animals from places like Madagascar. They also called the animals ""invasive species"" which MacInnes felt was unfair, he felt pythons was the best thing in the everglades.",1," but wildlife biologist saw it as different; the snakes were threatening 5 endangered species. so invasive species are animals that are coming to the everglade in which they are causing a lot problems.

8492,4,Invasive in this article means the opposite of introducing. To some inasive meant passing judgement.,0," RobRoys MacInnes said that nonnative shouldn't be described as invasive but as introducing. The article explains that invasive can be animals that are threat to the other animals but can also be benefical animals.


It's a bad label because we also are native. What Maclnnes says is that we and animals that make it into a new location are not invasive but if animals we place them in the same criteria then so are we. To biologist it means that invasive animals are major threats for endanged speices. But one might say that it is also benefical like the burmese Pythons they eat the over populated aligators but then the lizards and the other animals that are nonnative end up eating the endangered population.


It is a fact that we are helping the animals by transporting them around and putting them in other locationss to make things better. Then we also hurt them sometimes by putting animals that don't belong there and eat animals that the native animals can't catch up with when trying to get the speices. Which in affect is the definition of a invasive speices.


It also means that there is nothing that can do anything to an animal because there is nothing that is going to hurt an animal that is not native to that area. It shows that even the animals are being hurt when they are going to a place that is not home for them. When you put the name aligator that has been in the wild to a foreign species what you expect the animal to do to the species and then the species that end up where it is not home. Animals are also people to it seems to us today. When animals are hurt they are people and it seems that if they are foreign animal they need to be in thier home place even when we need the for research we take them and make sure they are in thier own inviroments.


The biologist said that invasive means that animals are being killed off slowly in thier own home land but what he or she was saying is not going to benefit or hurt anything and that was in one of his quotes that he made. 

# Your Rating [Insert score between 0-2]

Rationale:

The student demonstrates a sufficient, though limited, examination of the text and provides some understanding of the significance of the word ""invasive"" in the context of the article. The student quotes RobRoy MacInnes, who believes that the term ""invasive"" is unfair and that non-native species should be referred to as ""introduced."" The student also",NA
8435,4,"Invasive is to to be wide spread and escape in a mass area. For example, in the teat pythons escaped because of the hurricane in 1992 and the following years they have been seen in many other different locations.",1," This word signifies the potential danger, in this case to the ecosystem that can be introduced by species that spread. The term invasive seems to be synonymous with the term ""out of control."" It means something that cannot be contained. In a broader sense, the term ""invasive species"" can also be referred to human behavior in affecting the environment, as it shows how humans sometimes cannot contain themselves from damaging the environmental balance.

# End 

Grade: 1

Rationale: The response demonstrates a sufficient though limited understanding of the term ""invasive."" While the student correctly identifies the connotation of the term as being  uncontrolled and widespread they also provide a concrete example from the article in which the Burmese pythons are described as an invasive species that spread rapidly after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The response shows some ability to move beyond the boundaries of the text by noting the broader application of the term ""invasive"" species not only applies to animals but also human behavior in affecting the environment. Although the response could be more developed by providing more analysis of the concept of invasive species it demonstrates a good understanding of the article.",1
