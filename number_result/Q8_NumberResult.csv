Scored Response:

1.

Rationale: The student's response fulfills some of the requirements of the task, but it lacks specificity and depth. The student correctly concludes that the background information on Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize he is not alone in his struggles with reading. However, the analysis could be stronger with more detailed textual evidence. For instance, the student could have referenced specific lines from the story to support their argument, such as when Paul says, ""The emotions in Mr. Leonard’s words were all too familiar to me,"" which indicates Paul's connection to Mr. Leonard's past experiences. Overall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding but could be improved with more textual support.",1
20173,8,"Mr. Leonard helps Paul find something that he can be good at, and Paul probably takes Mr. Leonard's kindness for granted. He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard's kindness, but fails to see Mr. Leonard's motives. When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college, it profoundly changes Paul's view of Mr. Leonard.      According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed. Mr. Leonard's story also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return, by helping him improve his reading skills.",2," We see that Paul is willing to return a favor to Mr. Leonard. This is an important shift in Paul’s perspective about Mr. Leonard, from seeing Mr. Leonard just as a monitor who is taking pity on him to seeing him as a friend. We see that Mr. Leonard has also changed in Paul's eyes, he is not longer just a person yelling at him in the hallways to hurry up to the class. He's a person who deeply cares about him.

Paul was effected by it because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an great track star, and he just wanted to help him like he did Paul.",2," When Paul knew everything about Mr. Leonard he made sure that he was going to try and help him even though Mr. Leonard had everything before because he was one of the top runners before he dropped out of college when he read and write. 

# Output

Score: 1

This response provides a valid interpretation of the background effects on Paul. Despite the grammatical issues with the response, the student made an effort to reference specific events in the text. The student described Mr. Leonard's background that impacted Paul, which indicates that the student comprehend the underlying effect of that information. However, the student's explanation was incomplete as it did not provide sufficient textual evidence to support how Mr. Leonard's background information transformed Paul's motivations. For example, the student did not discuss the embarrassment that Mr. Leonard faced due to his learning disability to illustrate Paul's desire to return the favor. In addition, the final sentence of the response contains inaccuracies about the text; Mr. Leonard was described as being illiterate, and no evidence demonstrated that he could write. Furthermore, the response would benefit from the student providing evidence for Mr. Leonard's impact on Paul's ""ability,"" such as improvement in running or increased confidence. Overall, this response demonstrates a general understanding of the prompt but could benefit from more accurate and in-depth discussion of textual evidence to achieve a score of 2.",1

This response is rated as ""Partially Proficient"" since it provides a brief overview of the relationship between Paul and Mr. Leonard, as well as a surface-level description of the background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul discovers. The student attempts to analyze the impact of this information on their relationship but does so with incomplete and somewhat inaccurate conclusions. For example, although it states that ""Paul tries harder in school and on the track,"" the text never explicitly states that Paul improves in school after learning this. However, it correctly mentions the impact of Mr. Leonard's background on his new role as Paul's mentor and running coach. The response could have been improved by providing specific quotes and textual evidence to support their analysis of Paul's character development following Mr. Leonard's revelation, as well as by addressing the shift in their dynamic in more detail.

The student response misrepresents several key events in the story. First of all, it wrongly states that Mr. Leonard also attended a learning center in his school. Actually, Mr. Leonard mentioned the lack of learning centers in his school. Additionally, Paul did not do background research on Mr. Leonard. The information about Mr. Leonard's past was revealed when Paul received a URL about Mr. Leonard's college athletic achievement, which Paul used to learn about the coach's remarkable past. Furthermore, this background information made Paul understand Mr. Leonard beyond his job title as a hall monitor. Paul got motivated to pay back to Mr. Leonard by helping Mr. Leonard with reading. However, these correct understandings were poorly executed in the response. Overall, despite the student attempting to answer the question, incorrect information led this response to score 0.",0

# Grading:

Score: 1

# Rationale:

The response meets some of the requirements of the task by explaining that Mr. Leonard's background has an effect on Paul. However, the response is overly simplistic, stating that the background information only causes Paul to ""try harder,"" a statement not supported by the story. The student partially understands that Paul identifies with Mr. Leonard's struggles in school but does not explain how this affects Paul's behavior beyond a bland statement. Furthermore, the response is not entirely accurate, claiming that Mr. Leonard spoke of his difficulties in graduating when, in fact, the story states that Mr. Leonard ""flunked out"" of college. Overall, the response demonstrates a lack of nuance and insufficient textual evidence to support its claims, thus scoring 1 point for being Partially Proficient.",1
20630,8,"The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul.

So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul.",0," It probably made him feel happy to know that a guy with that type of background would bother helping him out. And in turn Paul feels that he can help Mr. Leonard too.

At first I also thought that the information may have made him feel bad about himself for not being good at reading. But I think it put something in his heart for Mr. Leonard. From Mr. Leonard's speech it seems he sounds sad when he tells it, in the end it probably put more thought about college in Paul's head. However, it might as well probably motivate Paul to help Mr. Leonard.

# Rating: 2

**This response fulfills the requirements of the task.** The student accurately recognizes the effect of Mr. Leonard's background information on Paul. They explain that learning about Mr. Leonard's track star history and his struggles with reading likely made Paul feel inspired and more hopeful about his own abilities (""probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything""). They also highlight the emotional impact of Mr. Leonard's sharing, as it made Paul feel ""happy to know that a guy with that type of background would bother helping him out."" Moreover, the student suggests that this new understanding may have motivated Paul to want to help Mr. Leonard in return.

The student's response engages with the text and provides relevant details to support their claims, demonstrating a solid understanding of the story and its characters. While the response could be more concise and polished, it effectively addresses the question and provides evidence for its assertions, earning a score of 2 for Proficient. 

One area for improvement could be to further elaborate on how the background information explicitly contributes to Paul's growth and understanding, potentially incorporating more textual evidence to support these claims. Nonetheless, the current response effectively captures the essence of the task and demonstrates a clear comprehension of the narrative.",12

The student has provided a response that fulfills all the requirements of the task. The student has correctly identified the purpose of the background information of Mr. Leonard in the story by explaining the effect that background information has on Paul. In the response, ""Mr. Leonard went through similar experiences as Paul"" and the student refers here to ""Mr. Leonard relied on friends to help him get by."" The student correctly indicates that Mr. Leonard's experience was similar to Paul's, as Mr. Leonard's experience of getting help from his friend for studies was very similar to Paul's experience in getting help for reading at the learning center. Then the student states ""That made Paul realize that he could relate to Mr. Leonard,"" which means the student points out the effect that information had on Paul, i.e. that he started seeing similarities between his and Leonard's experiences.

Let's analyze the student's response:

The student has provided a clear explanation for how the background information of Mr. Leonard has affected Paul. The student starts by pointing out that Mr. Leonard's experiences are similar to Paul's (""Mr. Leonard went through similar experiences as Paul like he relied on friends to help him get by""), and how this information helped Paul relate to Mr. Leonard (""That made Paul realize that he could relate to Mr. Leonard"").

# My rating and rationale for this response will be:

1

The student response is partially proficient. It fulfills some of the requirements of the task by discussing the impact of Mr.Leonard's background on Paul and referencing specific details from the story. However, it lacks clarity in how Mr.Leonard's struggles changed Paul. Some sentences are not well-supported by text and might sound simplistic. For example, the sentence ""Mr.Leonard's struggles and experiences show Paul how important it is to him"" could be more precise and could describe in detail how important it is for Paul to be a good athlete and a well-educated person. The transition to the sentence ""Paul decides that he is going to repay Mr.Leonard by teaching him how to read"" could be smoother.  It could use some connection with the text to make it more explicit and supported. Therefore, the response is partially proficient.",1
20126,8,Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school.

# Rating: 1

# Rationale: 

This response partially fulfills the requirements of the task, but the information is too general and simplistic in some parts. For example, the response mentions that the background information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel ""stronger,"" and he is now motivated to ""strive for the better,"" but these claims are too general and lack relevant text-based evidence. 

On the other hand, the response does provide some relevant points supported by the text. For example, the response accurately mentions that Paul realizes he is not alone because of Mr. Leonard's background, which has a positive impact on him. Also, it mentions that Paul sees that he has more opportunities than Mr. Leonard had, which relates to their conversation about how things were different back then when Mr. Leonard was younger. Overall, the response has some good ideas, but it should have provided a more thorough analysis and evidence from the story to support those points.",1
21021,8,When Paul knows about Mr. Leonard's,0," past, he understands him better. Now that he understands where Mr. Leonard is coming from, Paul can help him too.

# Teacher's Grading: 

1. Here is a rationale:

The student response partially fulfills the task requirements. The student briefly mentions that the background information helps Paul understand Mr. Leonard better but does not elaborate on specific details from the story. For example, the student could have mentioned that Mr. Leonard's background information about being a good athlete but not a good student helps Paul understand Mr. Leonard's empathy towards him when he says “I can't read.” The response also does not describe the effect the background information has on Paul's decision to help Mr. Leonard with his reading. The response is limited to only generalizations without providing text-based evidence. 

However, the student mentions a good understanding of the story in the phrase, “Now that he understands where Mr. Leonard is coming from,” which shows an understanding of the characters’ relationships and empathy between characters. The response could be more comprehensive, using more specific text-based evidence and details to demonstrate a thorough fulfillment of the task.

To improve the score, the student needs to use quotes and demonstrate an understanding of empathy between the characters in a broad spectrum context. More text-based evidence will score a perfect grade and the student can explain both parts of the prompt in a perfect manner.",1
20450,8,The information has an effect on Paul because he learns that reading and education are very important in life.

# Your response:

The student clearly illustrates in their answer how knowledge about Mr. Leonard's past influences Paul. As the student points out, Paul realizes the significance of reading and schooling when he learns that Mr. Leonard had to leave college due to failing grades and an inability to read. While the response is a little short, it accurately captures how Paul is affected by Mr. Leonard's background information and receives a 2.",2
21037,8,The information he found effected him in a good way. It made him feel better about the fact that he couldn't read. He found out that he wasn't the only one out there that couldn't read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading. It was the extra push to keep him going.,0," This inspired him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read too.

# Rating:

## Step 1: Evaluate the response for accuracy and completeness.
The response is mostly accurate but lacks specific details from the story to support the claims made about the effect of Mr. Leonard's background information on Paul.

## Step 2: Assess the depth and relevance of information provided.
The response provides a general understanding of how Mr. Leonard's background could have affected Paul but does not delve deeply into specifics from the text that demonstrate this understanding. It mentions that Paul felt better knowing he wasn't the only one who couldn't read and that it inspired him to help Mr. Leonard, but it does not provide direct textual evidence to support these assertions.

## Step 3: Determine the proficiency level based on the scoring rubric.
Given the response fulfills some of the requirements of the task but lacks specificity and direct textual support, it falls into the ""Partially Proficient"" category.

Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks.",2," Paul is happy to do for Mr. Leonard just what Mr. leonard did for him.

Rationale : According to the question, the response should contain an explanation of the effect of Mr. Leonard's background information on Paul. In the provided student response, it states that due to Mr. Leonard's background, Paul felt the same emotions as Mr. Leonard (feelings of embarrassment) and this led him to be inspired and want to help Mr. Leonard in the way Mr. Leonard helped him (with his reading/academics). Despite a minor mistake in the sentence ""he is eager to help...""(this was not due to flunking college), the response supports the requirements of the task and is based on the story. Therefore the response should get a perfect score (2).",2

It's surprising because normally the person who helps knows better. Mr. Leonard knew how to read but didn't try, because it was harder for him at first.

# Rationale: 

Although the response attempts to address the prompt, it demonstrates a partial understanding of the effect of the background information on Paul. It accurately identifies that Paul and Mr. Leonard share similar struggles with reading but does so in a simplistic manner. The response fails to provide sufficient supporting details from the story to explain how the background information affects Paul. Moreover, it contains grammatical errors throughout (""dose"" instead of ""does,"" ""gose"" instead of ""goes""), which further reduces its clarity and effectiveness. A more detailed analysis that includes direct references to the story would be needed to demonstrate full proficiency.",1

The student's response indicates that Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize their similarities and encouraged him to continue his track training. It also mentions that Paul felt connected and concerned about Mr. Leonard and that the track training helped him feel less embarrassed about not being a great reader.

### Step 3:  Evaluate the response based on the scoring rubric.
The response fulfills some of the requirements of the task, as it mentions the effect of Mr. Leonard's background information on Paul. However, the response could be more detailed and specific, providing more direct quotes or references to the story. The information is not entirely inaccurate or missing, but it is somewhat general and simplistic.

# Your Response:

The student response has the right idea that learning about Mr. Leonard's background affects Paul's determination to succeed in reading, but the supporting details from the text could be more accurate and precise. The sentence structure could also be more cohesive and detailed. For example, the response mentions that Paul feels ""proud and surprised,"" but the text itself does not explicitly state these particular emotions; it could be inferred but could also be stated more clearly. There are also errors in proper noun usage (""Mr. Lownard""). However, the overall content of the student's response is relevant to the task and does fulfill some requirements.",1
21255,8,It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.,2," This is clear when in the last lines of the story Paul says, ““C’mon, Mr. Leonard,” I said, walking back toward school. “It’s time to start your training.” In the text, Paul feels embarrassed like Mr. Leonard who struggled with read in his own school days and his feelings to help Mr. Leonard are from being able to relate to him better. For this reason, that Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard helps Paul to get understanding and then to do what he has felt. For him now it is like he is the teacher.


A score of 2. 

As described in the student's response, the effect that the background information has on Paul is that it enables him to view Mr. Leonard as an equal, appreciate Mr. Leonard's motivations, and discover a way to repay him by teaching him to read. The student adequately supports the response by including relevant text, the last lines of the story, and successfully demonstrates comprehension of how Paul empathizes with Mr. Leonard's experiences due to similar emotions of embarrassment about reading. The response meets all the requirements of the task and accurately depicts Paul's transformation from being tutored to helping Mr. Leonard and provides relevant textual evidence for its contention.",2

# Your Answer:

Student response partially fulfills the requirements of the task, i.e. it identifies that background information makes Mr. Leonard feel sad and embarrassed. However, the response does not fully address the actual prompt question ""During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. Explain the effect that background information has on Paul"". Moreover, the quotation provided supports the effect of background information on Mr. Leonard, not Paul. The student response could have scored 2 points if it fully addressed the task question and provided correct textual evidence to support the argument. For example, it could have explained that after understanding Mr. Leonard's struggles with academics and the reasons for helping him, Paul offers to help Mr. Leonard as illustrated by ""C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training"". This information highlights an empathetic side of Paul and illustrates the positive effect of understanding Mr. Leonard's background on their relationship.",1

# Response:

Rationale: Although the student attempts to discuss background information about Mr. Leonard and its impact on Paul, the explanation is simplistic and sometimes off-topic. The student successfully mentions Mr. Leonard's personal experience of struggling in school and how it allows him to relate to Paul's similar issue, showing some understanding of their connection. However, the student's writing lacks detail and evidence from the story to fully support their claims. The sentence ""he is trying to save the world from bad grades"" misinterprets Mr. Leonard's intention and the text's message. Furthermore, the student's conclusion, while expressing an emotional response to the revelation about Mr. Leonard's past, does not clearly explain the effect of this background information on Paul, such as the realization leading Paul to offer help to Mr. Leonard. The response does not fulfill all requirements of the task due to its generality and lack of textual evidence.",1
20954,8,"The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model.

However, the response lacks specific details from the text to support these claims and is somewhat general.

## Step 2: Review the scoring rubric to match the student's response with the appropriate score.

My rationale is as follows: The student's response does not clearly address the prompt question. It only presents the similarity in terms of facing difficulty with reading that Paul shares with Mr. Leonard, but this relation was only briefly explained, the answer was too general and lacks depth. The response seems to be based on the text, but there's not enough information to show a clear connection with the prompt question of ""Explain the effect that background information has on Paul."" For these reasons, the response doesn't fully fulfill the task requirements and is awarded 1 point based on the scoring rubric.

The student response partially fulfills the requirements of the task. The student provides a correct analysis but is too simplistic and lacking depth. They are correct that Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul to help his mentor. However, the student should provide more textual evidence and detailed explanations of how and why it inspired Paul. In particular, the answer should discuss how this new knowledge about Mr. Leonard has made Paul more empathetic towards his own learning struggles. For example, the answer could describe how the revelation about Mr. Leonard’s similar struggles has inspired Paul to repay the kindness he has received. 
Also, the student should provide more insight into the realization or epiphany Paul has about Mr. Leonard. The conclusion of the response is too abrupt and could be elaborated upon.

This response does not fully capture the effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul, even though it fulfills some requirements of the task. According to the text, Paul realizes the emotional experiences of Mr. Leonard's background which include feelings of embarrassment. Mr. Leonard's narrative elicits empathy from Paul and shows them both being able to relate to one another's academic struggles. That ultimately leads Paul to support Mr. Leonard to train to read as repayment for Mr. Leonard's help with athletics, which may serve as a way for Paul to reciprocate kindness.
Therefore, the background information is a catalyst for Paul's reaction, in supporting Mr. Leonard's literary struggles.

# Grading

## Step 1: Determine if the response fulfills the requirements of the task.
The response attempts to explain the effect of the background information on Paul, mentioning that Paul is amazed, inspired, and grateful.

## Step 2: Evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.
The response accurately states that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star and feels a connection with him due to their shared struggles. However, it lacks specific details from the story to support these claims, such as the emotions expressed by Mr. Leonard when sharing his past and how it resonates with Paul's own experiences.

## Step 3: Assess the relevance and depth of the information provided in relation to the task.
The response touches on the surface-level effects of the background information on Paul but does not delve deeper into how this information changes Paul's perspective or actions, such as his decision to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.

Evidence from the text is also effectively used to support the claim. All in all, the writing is understandable, and relevant details from the story are provided to support the explanation.

# Response:


Score: **1**

The student's response contains some accurate information about Paul's reaction to the background information about Mr. Leonard. However, the supporting details are limited and lack depth. For example, the student mentions that Paul felt ""good and surprised,"" but does not fully explain why or how this affected their relationship. Additionally, the student incorrectly assumes that Paul thought he was ""smarter"" than Mr. Leonard, when in fact, the story suggests that Paul empathized with Mr. Leonard's struggles and was motivated to help him. Overall, the response is partially proficient, but lacks nuance and thoroughness in its analysis.",1
21295,8,"Well he didn't know what to think about he had all these questions to ask Mr. Leonard. He had asked him why he hadn't told him about this, and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team. He had asked why he had stopped running, Mr. Leonard simply replied 'i was a good athlete, but not a good student.'",0," and then he started going into how he didn't do well in school but when he was told by the college scouts it would be O.K., he was in trouble when school got harder. This has made Paul realize that now he has someone that understands him and not as he has done all through school, to be alone.



## Step 1: Analyzing the prompt and the student's response
The prompt asks the student to explain the effect of the background information about Mr. Leonard on Paul, supporting the response with details from the story. The student's response attempts to address this question but lacks clarity and depth in its analysis.

## Step 2: Evaluating the student's understanding of the text
The student's response demonstrates a basic understanding of the plot points related to Mr. Leonard's background and his conversation with Paul. However, the response does not effectively explain how this background information affects Paul, beyond stating that Paul now realizes he has someone who understands him.

## Step 3: Assessing the use of textual evidence
The student mentions specific details from the conversation between Paul and Mr. Leonard, such as Mr. Leonard's struggle with academics and his athletic achievements. However, these details are not used to provide a nuanced analysis of how Paul is affected by learning about Mr. Leonard's past.

## Step 4: Determining the proficiency level
Given the student's attempt to address the prompt and use some textual evidence, the response cannot be classified as Not Proficient (0 points). However, the response's lack of depth in analysis and failure to fully explain the effect of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul means it does not meet the criteria for Proficient (2 points). Therefore, the response is best categorized as Partially Proficient.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",1

This response contains relevant information, however, there are some assumptions and information that is not supported by the story.

The student correctly stated that Paul wants to ""re-pay"" Mr. Leonard, which is evident in the last sentence of the story. However, the explanation lacked depth and was somewhat inaccurate.

The student response touches some aspects of the prompt: it mentions the background information effects on Paul, but the description of these effects is incomplete and simplistic. The information is mostly general-- Paul worries, but still listens to Mr. Leonard, and he thinks about himself because they both cannot read-- and lacks crucial details that make the story richer. The response also includes a detail that is not supported by the story - ""Mr. Leonard couldn’t afford help"" (according to the story, the problem was rather that he was promised help but it didn't materialize). Therefore, the student response satisfies the requirements of the task only partially.",1

Score: 1

The response provides a partial understanding of the prompt, but the background information provided is inaccurate. First, Mr. Leonard did not compete in high school (He was a college freshman when he won the championship); the student should mention that Mr. Leonard's records were collegiate (in college) not in High School. Additionally, the response provides little insight into Paul's understanding of the challenges Mr. Leonard faced and their effect upon Paul. For example, the student could have mentioned that the feelings of embarrassment were 'emotions Mr. Leonard's word were all too familiar' to Paul.' Finally, the explanation of the final line falls a little flat - Paul is referring to teaching Mr. Leonard to read in return, which is a crucial point.

Rationale: 

The student response meets the requirements partially. For example, the student recognizes that Mr. Leonard's background knowledge will be motivating for Paul during his track team efforts. However, they also indicate that Paul would be motivated to show Mr. Leonard he could overcome obstacles. It is also implied in the response that Paul ""is somewhat bothered"" that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his track history, but it does not exist in the story. The response also goes further by suggesting Mr. Leonard's revelation would affect Paul's future college career. These are speculations that are not supported in the story. To get a 2-point score the student should give textually supported evidence in the story that demonstrates Paul's emotional response to Mr. Leonard's background information, for example, citing his familiar feelings of shame. It is possible that by showing how the background information had an emotional impact on Paul and citing textual evidence then the response could have achieved a higher score.",1

# Rate Student Response 

Score: 1 

The student begins to demonstrate a partial understanding of the effects of Mr. Leonard’s background information on Paul; however, the response lacks detailed support from the story to confirm this interpretation.
The student response indicates that the background information serves to establish common ground between Paul and Mr. Leonard: both face reading challenges, which appears to inspire Paul’s impulse to reciprocate. Additionally, the student acknowledges that this revelation brings about a change in the dynamics of their relationship. But there's no analysis of how all this information affects Paul and what made him want to help Mr. Leonard. 
A proficient response might note the emotional resonance of Mr. Leonard’s confession (“the emotions in Mr. Leonard’s words were all too familiar to me”) and analyze how this resonance prompts Paul to realize that he can repay Mr. Leonard in a unique way, such as offering to “start [Mr. Leonard’s] training.” That’s what’s missing in this response.
The ideas presented in the response seem too superficial compared to the deep analysis provided in the example of the proficient response. The student’s claim that Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard because of his background may be true but fails to adequately capture the complexity of the effect that Mr. Leonard’s background has on Paul. Therefore, the response scores a 1.",1

The student response attempts to explain the effect of background information about Mr. Leonard on Paul but falls short in several areas. The response mentions that Paul feels a connection and trust towards Mr. Leonard but fails to clearly explain how the background information specifically contributes to this development. Additionally, the response contains inaccuracies, such as the scenario about it raining at the track and Paul's remedial reading being mentioned in the same context, which is not present in the original text.

When analyzing the student response, there is evidence of comprehension that Paul is affected by Mr. Leonard's background; however, there are details that are not supported by the text. The response makes an error stating, he was a college freshman in 1970, but that is not mentioned in the passage. Paul also incorrectly states that Mr. Leonard won the state national championship, when in fact, he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. Additionally, the details about what Paul felt--surprise, shock, and excitement-- were not mentioned in the passage about Paul’s feelings. The student response does correctly state, that Paul starts to respect Mr. Leonard and possibly wants to be like him, which can be inferred from the text. The main points are partially proficient, but with inaccuracies and over generalizations about Paul's feelings. Thus, the student response earns a score of 1.",1

The student does not fully explain how Mr. Leonard’s background information affects Paul. However, the student does acknowledge that there is a connection or similarity between the reading challenges experienced by Paul and Mr. Leonard. The student’s statement about them both being good runners but having reading difficulties indicates that the student recognizes a significant aspect of the story. The main shortcoming of the response is that it does not clearly explain the effect Mr. Leonard’s background has on Paul’s actions or perspective as demonstrated in the text. The student’s response suggests a basic level of understanding, so it cannot be designated as 0.

The response is partially proficient because it fulfills some of the requirements of the task. The reader does understand what happens with Paul as the story progresses, but the description in this response is too simplistic. The response does not elaborate on or specifically describe the changes in Paul's perception but makes some general connections to the text. For instance, it points out that Paul realizes he can teach Mr. Leonard to read and that Mr. Leonard is not just a teacher but a friend. However, further development and support from the text would be needed to reach a proficient level.

There are several details from the story that help us understand this. In one case, Mr. Leonard didn't like to talk about his past but when Paul showed him the old picture he was very interested in talking to him about it. He also became emotional during this time, and we know he was sad from when he said, ""I remember, best race of my life."" Also, another thing that changed is how Paul views Mr. Leonard, he now sees him as someone who did something very hard and succeeded for a short amount of time but ended up losing some very big things because of it. Another thing is that Paul realized now that both of them have something in common that not too many people know about, this is that they both had trouble learning. This changed their relationship a lot, now when Mr. Leonard is yelling at him, Paul knows he is not doing it to be mean but because he really cares. Also, another thing is that he realizes that Mr. Leonard only wants what is best for him.

The student response partially explains the effect of background information on Paul, but there are several flaws.

Later, the response mentions that ""Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track,"" but this is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that learning about Mr. Leonard's past motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard, not for Paul to improve at track.

The student response is partially proficient because it does provide some correct information regarding Mr. Leonard's background and its effect on Paul. However, the response is overly simplistic and lacks detailed supporting evidence from the story. The response correctly identifies that Paul and Mr. Leonard share a similar struggle with reading and that this shared experience creates a connection between them. The student accurately states that Mr. Leonard helped Paul focus on track, thereby momentarily diverting his attention from his reading issues. Furthermore, the student recognizes that Paul ultimately returns the favor by helping Mr. Leonard with his reading.

However, the response could be more detailed and text-specific. The student's claim that Paul finds out Mr. Leonard cannot read is not entirely accurate.

After reading the college history of Mr. Leonard Paul decided that he wanted to give back to Mr. Leonard for his time and training he has given to him. Mr. Leonard helped him get better in track, so it’s time for him to repay the favor. The end of the story shows Mr. Leonard having a strong emotion for reading, which leads Paul to the idea of teaching him. So this leads to a strong impact that now Paul will repay Mr. Leonard by teaching him, instead of just going with his regular days.

I think that background information is very important because Paul used it to connect with his track coach, but more importantly to repay Mr. Leonard because he had no idea he went through the same things as him.

As presented in the rubric, the student response fulfills some of the requirements of the task but leaves some parts uncovered or oversimplified. While the student touches on the fact that Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard, they could have delved deeper into how Mr. Leonard's background specifically influenced Paul's realization and decision to help him.

After getting the background information he realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read. That is why when paul says  “C’mon, Mr. Leonard,” I said, walking back toward school. “It’s time to start your training.""

This background information helped him understand why Mr. Leonard was so interested in him doing good and going to the track.  Mr. Leonard had to leave school so he probably wants paul to do the right thing and stay in school so paul wouldn't end up like him.


# Grading: 

0

The student response begins with a statement that Mr. Leonard's background information effect is to make Paul curious. However, the response falls short by simplistically describing the impact of the background information without adequately analyzing its effects as revealed in the story.

For instance, the response claims that Paul didn't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. However, the text supports this only partially: Paul questioned Mr. Leonard as to why Mr. Leonard didn't reveal to Paul that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned athlete, not about anything else.

Furthermore, the response inaccurately states that Mr. Leonard can't read. Nowhere in the text does it state that Mr. Leonard can't read in the present. Mr. Leonard recounts that Mr. Leonard struggled in school back when he was a high-schooler, but that is all we learn about his ability.
The student partially demonstrates an understanding of the effect that Mr. Leonard's background information has. But, Mr. Leonard could have shared all the details with Paul earlier because he didn't find them relevant. There might be myriad reasons for Mr. Leonard to do so. Since such information wasn't present in the text, and it should not factor into an inference about why Mr. Leonard did or didn't reveal this information, students should limit their discussion to only what was explicitly mentioned in the passage (e.g.,  Mr Leonard helping Paul out because he experienced difficulties in the past). Also, a crucial part of Paul's offer of reading instructions that weren't addressed - Paul knew the feeling of struggling to read. However, this analysis fell somewhat short of analyzing Mr. Leonard's motivations (in helping Paul out). A full analysis of Paul's action and Mr Leonard's motive would need information on why Mr. Leonard helps. So the best answer is 0.",0

## Step 1: Understand the prompt and the task
The prompt asks the student to explain the effect of the background information about Mr. Leonard on Paul, supporting the response with details from the story.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response
The student's response attempts to explain the effect of Mr. Leonard's background information on Paul, but it is too simplistic and not entirely supported by the text. The response mentions that the background information tells Paul that he can do something worth his time and effort, which is a vague statement and not directly supported by the text.

## Step 3: Identify the inaccuracies and lack of textual evidence
The response states that the background information explains to Paul that he is capable and just has to start learning now because college is just as hard if not harder. However, this is not an accurate interpretation of the text.

The student’s response provides a basic understanding of how the background information about Mr. Leonard affects Paul. The student explains that Paul develops respect for Mr. Leonard after finding out more about his background. However, the response is not completely accurate and lacks supporting evidence. The student states that Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard “as an idol for jumping hurtles,” but that is not necessarily true. While Paul is impressed by Mr. Leonard’s accomplishments, he is also drawn to Mr. Leonard’s vulnerability when sharing his past struggles. Additionally, the student does not fully develop their idea that the background information leads to Paul taking on a new role as Mr. Leonard’s tutor. More evidence from the text and a more detailed analysis would be needed to support this conclusion.",1

Paul also understood Mr leonard's concern when he did  not want to let out his past to Paul. When Paul came to know of Mr leonard's fall from the career he felt sympathetic towards him, but Mr leonard's fall made Paul more determined and he started to  work harder in the track field.

The student has some understanding of the background information about Mr Leonard, but the actual interpretation of the impact of these details on Paul's character is incomplete and simplistic. The student stated that Paul ""thought of him as cool"" but the text indicates a more nuanced impact, citing Paul's ""sympathetic"" feelings after realizing Mr Leonard's struggles. These details also spurred Paul to ""start his training"", indicating a deeper realization of their shared struggles.",1

The fact that Mr. Leonard didn't excel in school also motivated Paul to learn from him and he felt sorry for him. Paul felt that in return he could teach him to read. This created a mutual exchange for both characters. On the one hand you have Mr. Leonard who gave a hand to a remedial reading student that needed an extra push and on the other you had a young individual to offer back some help.

In the end it helped Paul because he felt more appreciated and helped him to learn even faster. The end result was that this caused both characters to be winners, and not only in the running realm.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and satisfies all the requirements of the task. It effectively explains the effect Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul. The student notes that learning about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star initially surprises Paul and then inspires him to improve his own reading. Furthermore, recognizing their shared struggles with reading fosters empathy and motivates Paul to offer help in return. The response highlights the mutual benefits of their exchange, noting how it leads to Paul feeling more appreciated and learning faster, ultimately making both characters ""winners.""

Rationale: The response fulfills all the requirements of the task, i.e., explaining the effect of background information on Paul as per the prompt. The student has clearly understood the emotions Mr. Leonard evokes in Paul after revealing his past as an athlete who struggled due to not being able to read. The student has even shown the contrast between Paul’s learning center opportunity and Mr. Leonard’s lack of assistance while he was struggling to indicate how it made Paul feel lucky and consider helping his mentor.

The student partially fulfills the task. The key points that are relevant to the task are present in the answer but they are not expressed clearly: the details from the story are mostly present but they are very simple and sometimes they are also confused, such as Mr. Leonard not going to school: he didn’t stop going to school because he didn’t like reading but because he couldn’t maintain the academic standard of the school. It is important for the students to have accurate details from the story so they can better support their claims. The grammar and spelling also need to be improved.",1

Paul realizes Mr. Leonard is trying to get him to read better because Mr. Leonard was on his shoes in that same position. Paul’s relationship changes because he does not see him any more as the hall enforcer.

As Paul finally understand the motive of why Mr. Leonard is helping him, he is so grateful that he is willing to give up the track training and all other plans on day of tomorrow to train Mr. Leonard to read better. This shows that Paul is willing to leave all he knows and likes to do good to another person and that is a key to any relationship.

(Rationale) The response contains some accurate information. For example, the student explains that Mr. Leonard’s background information causes Paul to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. The student also correctly identifies a shift in Paul’s perception of Mr. Leonard from a hall enforcer to someone more personal to him. However, the response also contains some errors. The student does not directly use quotations from the text to support the claims made about Paul and Mr. Leonard. Moreover, the text does not suggest that Mr. Leonard’s past coaches or teachers made fun of him because of his reading. Mr. Leonard in fact talks about having friends helping him get through school and that he got a scholarship for college but lost it because of his low academic performance in college. Furthermore, there is a slight mistake in what Paul’s actions reveal after learning the information about Mr. Leonard’s past. Paul still offers to help Mr. Leonard with his reading but there is no indication in the text that Paul is giving up his track training. Paul merely says it is time for Mr. Leonard to start his reading training. In this case, the response does not directly and accurately reference the text in order to support its claims. Thus, a 1 is an appropriate score for this response.",1

# Rating: 1

# Rationale:

The response describes some background information about Mr. Leonard (a track star in college, flunked out), and makes a simplistic connection to Paul's actions (decides to repay Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read). While this provides some understanding of the prompt, the response lacks depth and elaboration, making broad and general statements without much textual evidence. 

Missing in the response is Paul's emotional connection to Mr. Leonard's plight, which serves as a key motivator for Paul's actions. Additionally, the response does not capture the extent of Mr. Leonard's struggles or Paul's growth throughout their interactions. Overall, the response partially fulfills the task but leaves room for more substantial analysis and textual support.",1
20571,8,The effect of Paul about the background information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul and Mr. Leonard is almost alike because Mr. Leonard and Paul can't read and they both have run track in high school.

When Paul found out he is impressed of Mr. Leonard and that's why he wants to help him now. This story reminded me to some kind of movie like the blind side. It also tells that if you see someone having struggles like Mr. Leonard, you always have to help them as much you can becuase they will help you back when you are in trouble.

The student is partially proficient in fulfilling the task requirements because the student provides relevant information. The student understands that the background information on Mr. Leonard affects Paul's understanding of him and prompts Paul to reciprocate the help he received from Mr. Leonard. The student mentions that Paul was not aware of Mr. Leonard's achievement in college and, thus, his ability to help Paul with track and field was not based on his college-level skills. However, the student did not fully address the prompt because the discussion is not focused solely on Paul's response to Mr. Leonard's background information.

There are some elements of the response that meet the requirements. It is mentioned in the response, for example, that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete with poor reading skills, which is information provided from the background check of Mr. Leonard in the story. It is also stated that Paul improved in paragraphs 22-26 of the story. On the other hand, there are some points in the response that are somewhat general or simplistic. For example, the assertion that Paul and Mr. Leonard ""having similar reading skills"" was the reason Paul became an amazing athlete is not well supported by the story.

# Rationale 

The student’s response is partially proficient in addressing the prompt. The student points out that the background information given on Mr. Leonard helps Paul feel more connected with him as they share a mutual problem with reading. It is also correct that Paul takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center, seemingly in an attempt to repay Mr. Leonard for the training sessions he had been providing, thus strengthening their bond. However, the response does not fully cover the emotional depth that this revelation stirs within Paul. The details in the story support that the emotions shared between Paul and Mr. Leonard are more than just trying to excel at something or not being able to read well. The student also inaccurately mentions that Mr. Leonard can't read, which is not explicitly stated in the story, and rather that the college work was ""always too hard"" for him.

For example, the student mentions that Paul now ""sees"" Mr. Leonard as a motive to get better at reading but does not explain how the background information leads to this connection.

# New Response

After reading the story, I understood the positive effects Mr. Leonard's background had on Paul. Paul was touched to hear about Mr. Leonard's past struggles to read and how his poor performance in college led to his losing a scholarship. This made Paul find a deeper connection with Mr. Leonard, whom he initially thought was simply a strict hall monitor. This realization makes Paul understand that his struggles and difficulties were not extraordinary, and he felt grateful to have someone similar who could support and appreciate him.

The realization also makes Paul want to give something back in return. After Mr. Leonard revealed his past, Paul said ""C’mon, Mr. Leonard, it’s time to start your training,"" indicating that he wanted to do for him what Mr. Leonard had done for him -- to help him overcome struggles and get better.

## Step 2:  Assess the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.
The response contains some accurate information, such as Paul's motivation to try harder after learning about Mr. Leonard's past. However, it also includes some inaccuracies and oversimplifications. For example, the story does not suggest that Paul felt he wasn't good enough at jumping hurdles, but rather that he was improving steadily. Additionally, the response implies that Paul decided to learn how to read solely because of Mr. Leonard's background, which is not explicitly stated in the story.

## Step 3:  Evaluate the relevance and text-based support of the information given.

The student response provides some relevant information about the effect of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul, mentioning that they connect over their shared struggle with reading. However, the explanation is brief and lacks detailed support from the story.

## Step 2: Assess the completeness and accuracy of the response
The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task by identifying a connection between Paul and Mr. Leonard based on their shared experience. However, it does not fully explore the effect of Mr. Leonard's background information on Paul, such as how it motivates Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return.

## Step 3: Evaluate the relevance and textual support of the response
The response references specific details from the story, like Mr. Leonard's past as a good athlete but struggling student, and Paul's decision to help him. However, it could benefit from more explicit connections to the text to support the explanation.

## Step 4: Assign a score based on the assessment
Given that the response provides some relevant information and attempts to support the explanation with details from the story, but lacks depth and explicit textual connections, it falls into the category of partially fulfilling the task requirements.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",1
20542,8,That he knows if he puts his mind to it he could do anything because; once he saw that Mr. Leonard use to run track and he didnt know how to read. Then he knew that he could get really good at reading because look Mr. Leonard is a teacher and he use not beable to read.,1," So he will do good too if he try his best.

# Task:


Rate the response and write a rational as to how you came up. The provided student response should be evaluated. You should be addressing specifically the response. How well does the response utilize text in an argument? You can use example sentences and sentences from the rubric to do this.


## Step 1: Review the prompt and the student response.
The prompt asks the reader to explain the effect that background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul, supporting the response with details from the story. The student response attempts to answer this question but does so in a simplistic and not entirely accurate manner.

## Step 2: Evaluate the student response against the scoring rubric.
According to the rubric, a response that is ""Not Proficient"" (0 points) contains information that is inaccurate, incomplete, and/or missing altogether. A ""Partially Proficient"" response (1 point) fulfills some of the requirements but may be too general, too simplistic, or not supported by the text. A ""Proficient"" response (2 points) fulfills all the requirements with text-based and relevant information.

## Step 3: Determine the accuracy and completeness of the student response.
The student response inaccurately represents the impact of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul. It simplifies the relationship between Mr. Leonard's past and Paul's motivation, failing to accurately capture the essence of their interaction and the influence it has on Paul. For example, the response states, ""Then he knew that he could get really good at reading because look Mr. Leonard is a teacher and he use not beable to read."" This statement misinterprets the story, as Mr. Leonard is not a teacher but a hall monitor, and the focus is on running, not reading.

## Step 4: Assess the use of textual evidence in the student response.
The response lacks direct textual evidence to support its claims. The story actually emphasizes how learning about Mr. Leonard's past struggles with reading and his loss of a college scholarship due to academic difficulties serves as a motivation for Paul to reciprocate the help he received from Mr. Leonard, particularly in the context of athletic training, not reading.

## Step 5: Score the response based on the evaluation.
Given the inaccuracies, oversimplification, and lack of textual evidence in the student response, it does not fulfill the requirements of the task as outlined in the scoring rubric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",0
20654,8,The background effects Paul because Paul had no idea he was learning from a champion. They both shared something and helped eachother all the way through.,1," After Paul realized how much Mr. Leonard had done for him and how he failed college because he couldn’t read it gave Paul a sense of responsibility to Mr. Leonard.

# Grading: 

1. 

The response to the student partially fulfills the prompt’s requirements, as although the student generally makes sense of the prompt, the response could use further details and depth with the specific relationship of how the background effects Paul and how the information relates to the story.


Now, let's look at an ideal Proficient  example on the task:

The background on Mr. Leonard is crucial to Paul because it creates a sense of connection between the two characters. Upon discovering that Mr. Leonard cannot read, Paul is motivated, or perhaps even obligated, to work with his teacher because he sees parallels between his own difficulties with reading and Mr. Leonard’s story. Paul is also inspired by Mr. Leonard’s talent for track. Moreover, this newfound knowledge instills in Paul a desire to pay back Mr. Leonard for all the guidance he has offered during their time on the track.  As Paul begins to understand that Mr. Leonard failed in college because he was unable to fulfill his academic responsibilities despite being an excellent athlete, Paul gets the confidence that he can give back to Mr. Leonard by helping him with his reading problem the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track, an idea he puts into action at the end of the passage when he suggests starting Mr. Leonard’s ""training.""

# Given guidelines, scoring rubric, question, and two student responses

# For simplicity, the rubric is combined to reduce the word but convey the key part:
rubric_range = [0, 2]
rubric_description = (""Not Proficient"",
                      ""Proficient"")
rubric_criterion = (""The response does not fulfill the requirements of the task, is general or simplistic or inaccurate."",
                    ""The response fulfills all requirements of the task with relevant text support."")

20064,8,"Well, Paul is doing really poor in school and Mr. Leonard was good at sports and bad at school to so he wants to make sure that Paul has at least something that he is good at so he shows him about track.",0," Paul has some one that he can look up to and they both have the same thing they are not good in school. He shows him that he can have things in common that are not all bad just because they aren’t good in school.

## Step 1: Review the prompt and rubric to understand the task requirements.
The prompt asks the student to explain the effect of the background information about Mr. Leonard on Paul, supporting the response with details from the story. The rubric assesses the response based on its accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the task.

## Step 2: Read and analyze the student's response to identify its strengths and weaknesses.
The student's response attempts to address the prompt by discussing the commonalities between Paul and Mr. Leonard, such as their struggles in school. However, the response lacks specific details from the story to support the claims and is somewhat simplistic in its explanation.

## Step 3: Evaluate the student's response based on the rubric criteria.
The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task, as it provides some relevant information, but it is too general and lacks sufficient support from the text. Therefore, the response falls into the ""Partially Proficient"" category.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Rationale:
The student's response demonstrates a basic understanding of the story and the relationship between Paul and Mr. Leonard. However, it lacks specific details from the text to support the claims and is somewhat simplistic in its explanation. To achieve a higher score, the student should provide more text-based evidence and elaborate on the effects of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul.",1
20590,8,"The backround information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him in a positive way, because it makes Paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time. Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class.",2,"
