26626,10,white ::  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them.,1," the light gray and dark gray are almost in the middle with the temperatures and the white and black are the two most extreme out of all of them because the white had the smallest most low temperature of 42 and the black had the highest bigest temperature of 53.


## Step 1: Review the student's response to identify key components.
The student chose the color white for the doghouse, stating it would make the inside cooler because white reflects sun rays, as opposed to black which absorbs them.

## Step 2: Assess if the student described how the chosen color might affect the inside of the doghouse.
The student provided a clear description of how the color white would affect the inside of the doghouse, making it cooler due to its reflective properties.

## Step 3: Evaluate if the student used results from the experiment to support their description.
The student referenced the experimental results, noting that white had the lowest temperature of 42°C and black the highest of 53°C, which supports their choice of white for a cooler interior.

## Step 4: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
Given that the student chose a color, described how that color would affect the inside of the doghouse, and used results from the experiment to support their description, the response meets all criteria for a 2-point score.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
27289,10,white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object,1," for the room.
For white a average of 42 degrees Celsius vs. the black which had 53.
The 42 was for inside the glass jar, I can make it a doghouse room.

# Suggested Response:

The best color for painting the doghouse is white.
The white house would have a cooler interior compared to the other colors. This is because the light-colored house will reflect the radiation from the sun, rather than absorb it (whereas dark colors absorb more energy).
The experimental evidence supports this description. Based on the results provided, the white doghouse will have an internal temperature of approximately 42° C. In comparison, the interior of a black doghouse will reach about 53° C, causing the black doghouse to reach an internal temperature 11° C higher than that of the white doghouse.


# Your response

This response chooses a color, white, and provides results from the experiment, such as the average temperature for the white lid (42° C) compared to the black lid (53° C). However, it lacks a clear description of how the white color might affect the inside of the doghouse. The statement ""The 42 was for inside the glass jar, I can make it a doghouse room"" is unclear and does not provide a sufficient explanation. Therefore, this response demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard and earns 1 point."

Rating:

Rationale: The response demonstrates that the student has a partial understanding of the Content Standard. They choose a color (dark gray) and provide a general explanation for how this color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""it is not as hot as black but it is not as cool as light gray or white""). However, they do not explicitly use results from the experiment (""it is not as hot as black"" does not explicitly reference the 53°C average for black or the 48°C average for dark gray). Therefore, this response does not fully meet the standards for a 2-point response and receives 1 point."

When you use white color temperature was 9(DEG)C lower than when you use dark color.,2," In the doghouse it's better to use white color so that it w ill not be hot because color can affect the te mperat ure .

# Grading Guidelines:


The task for this item requires students to use results from a scientific experiment to design an aspect of technology, specifically a doghouse.  This item focuses on students using science to make an informed decision about technology. Students must use the results from the experiment to justify their color choice for the doghouse design.


When grading this question, focus on the relationship between the color choice, the experimental results, and the explanation of why this color is best for the doghouse design. The following are examples of how a student might earn each possible score:


2 points -A response states to paint the doghouse white, as the student noticed the temperature inside the jar was cooler (average temperature= 42°C) when using a white lid than when using a black lid (average temperature=53°C). The student goes on to mention that using white would keep the doghouse cooler.


1 point - The student selects the white color for the doghouse but justifies their response by mentioning the color they liked best was white and did not tie results to the dog house design.


1 point -  The student does select a color (white)  and then indicates if using light color the temperatures are lower than dark color but provided that response without reference to the doghouse . .


A 0-point response might only involve the selection of color, a response that mentions the temperatures without any mention of doghouse design or merely writes that white reflects light.


Note:  Student's response may include some errors, as long as they mention experimental results that support what they select, and explain that selection in terms of how it impacts a doghouse, 2 points could still be awarded.


When grading, remember, we're looking to see if students describe how the selected color might impact the inside of the doghouse AND that impact is justified with experimental results and if NOT award accordingly.


# Response Assessment:

The student selected white paint for the doghouse based on the experiment's result. They correctly explained how the white color affects the inside of the doghouse by stating, ""In the doghouse it's better to use white color so that it w ill not be hot because color can affect the te mperat ure."" The student also provided data from the experiment by mentioning, ""when you use white the temperature was42(DEG)C but when you use black the temperature was 53(DE"
27343,10,black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot,1," and the results show that too


Rating: 

Rationale: Student's response meets only partial requirements set in the rubric. While the student does select a paint color and mentions that the results support their assertion, the response does not provide an adequate description of how the black color will affect the inside of the doghouse beyond stating it will ""make the dog house really hot."" Thus, the student only demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard. The mention of ""the sun will be attracted to black"" does not accurately use results from the experiment to support the description since the experiment is about a lamp and color effect, not about the sun specifically. Because of the lack of detailed, informed description of the color's effect on the inside of the doghouse, the response cannot be considered to fulfill all the criteria for a 2-point response. However, it does choose a color and references the results, thus meriting a 1-point rating over a 0-point one."
26982,10,black ::  it is warmer than other colors,1,". it  would make the dog house warmer.

dog house should be painted black. in the chart light gray=45c,white=42c,dark grey=48c,Black=53c. so black has most heat. so dog house should be black.
black makes it warmer.

# Response:

1
The response chose a paint color, which is black, and included the results from the experiment, by using data from the chart and explaining that black has more heat than other colors. However, the description of how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse is too simplistic and vague, only stating it makes it warmer without any further explanation or connection to the results. Therefore, the student demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard and achieves a score of 1."
27534,10,"white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.",2," the dog might want it cooler. dogs like to play a lot outside and he might get hot because it is too much energy and then the dog might get too hot and get a heat stroke.


## Step 1: Determine if the student has chosen a paint color.
The student has chosen white as the paint color for the doghouse.

## Step 2: Determine if the student has described how the chosen color might affect the inside of the doghouse.
The student describes that a white color would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler.

## Step 3: Determine if the student has used results from the experiment to support the description.
The student uses the data from the experiment, stating that white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degrees Celsius, to support the choice of white as the best paint color.

## Step 4: Apply the scoring rubric to rate the student's response.
Based on the scoring rubric, the student's response demonstrates an understanding of the Content Standard by choosing a color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
27260,10,"black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that",1," , so this is what dog house must be colored in . the black dog house gets the temperature to become worm faste then other colurs in less then 10 mintes and it will be warm on the colds days be couse 53 > dark gray light gray and white and the dog house will be happy


# Step 1: Step 1 description
The student response needs to be evaluated according to the provided scoring rubric, which assesses the student's understanding of the Content Standard regarding technological design processes and their ability to describe a reason for choosing a solution given possible solutions and a problem.

## Step 2: Step 2 description
The student's response includes choosing black as the paint color for the doghouse and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, mentioning that it gets warm faster than other colors. They also attempt to use results from the experiment to support their description, mentioning the temperature of 54 degrees and comparing it to the temperatures of other colors.

## Step 3: Step 3 description
However, the response lacks clarity and contains grammatical errors. Despite these issues, the core elements required by the rubric are present: choosing a color, describing its effect on the doghouse, and referencing experimental results.

## Step 4: Step 4 description
Based on the rubric, a response that fulfills all the criteria (choosing a color, describing its effect, and using experimental results) is worth 2 points. Although the response is not perfectly articulated, it meets the fundamental requirements outlined in the rubric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
27188,10,white :: If the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog.,1," If the lid is black then it's hotter inside than if the lid is white so the dog will be cooler in the dog house and not get too hot.


## Step 1: Analyze the student's response according to the scoring rubric.
The student's response chooses a color for the doghouse (white) and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""it will be cooler in the dog house for the dog"").

## Step 2: Determine if the response uses results from the experiment to support the description.
The response mentions a comparison between the black lid and the white lid from the experiment, indicating an attempt to use results to support the choice of color.

## Step 3: Assess if the response fully meets the criteria for a 2-point rating.
The response partially meets the criteria by choosing a color and describing its effect but only superficially references the experiment's results without fully integrating them into the reasoning for the color choice.

## Step 4: Decide the score based on the analysis.
Given that the response partially meets the criteria by choosing a color and describing its effect but does not fully utilize the experiment's results to support the description, it aligns more closely with a partial understanding of the Content Standard.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
26220,10,"black ::  If you paint the doghouse black, the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white.",1," That's because the darker colores would absorb more light energy that comes in, which causes the temp to increase.

1
Rationale:
This response scores a 1 because it does not fully match the description of a correct response based on the rubric. The student has chosen a color and described how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (the doghouse will be warmer inside), but results from the experiment that support this choice are missing. There is a mention that darker colors absorb more light energy, but the actual data from the experiment should be provided as evidence. Thus, since the first part of the requirement (description of impact) is met but the second part (use of experimental results) isn't, it scores 1 out of 2."

# Your Rating, Rationale:

1

The student has partial understanding of the Content Standard. The response chooses a color and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse by stating that white is a better choice because it absorbs less heat, and the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. The response includes results from the experiment, noting the average temperature of 53 C after 10 minutes using a dark-colored lid and 42 C after using a light-colored lid (white). However, the student missed the fact that starting temperature is the correct value of the temperature that does not represent the ambient, which is the starting air temperature inside the jar, and the student had several incorrect assumptions based on incorrect temperature differences and the understanding of absorption in different colors that do not necessarily match the results; this results is that the student demonstrated incomplete understanding of the question or the results."

The student response correctly answers the prompt, meeting all conditions. A color is chosen - light gray, and a description is provided about how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse. The student also included results from the experiment that support their description, pointing out that this color is effective at raising the temperature (24 to 45 degrees C) but not so high that the doghouse would be too hot."
27001,10,"dark gray :: I choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relax ing amount of heat.",1," It had around 48 degres C. The dog would like it. So that is why I think dark gray is the best color. The doghouse wouldnt have to be in the sun as much because dark grey can bring the heat in. It gives perfect heat that would make the dog very happy.

Score:

Rationale:
The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the Content Standard, satisfying all requirements specified in the rubric for a 2-point response. The student chooses a paint color (dark gray), explains how it might affect the inside of the doghouse (""it's not as hot as black but it isn't too cold like white,"" and ""it has a perfect temperature for the dog""), and supports their choice with results from the experiment (""it had around 48 degrees C""), illustrating how the color can provide a comfortable temperature for the dog without absorbing too much heat.
```"
27558,10,white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light,1,". If the inside temperature is to high for the dog it will over heat and die. The doghouse outside temp was not in the data table. If you paint it white it wont get too hot. The average temp on the white lid was lower than the others. So we should paint it white.


# Your turn:


1


Rationale:
The student response receives a 1-point rating because while they have selected a paint color (white) and referenced the results of the experiment, the explanation of how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse is brief and not fully supported by the experimental data. The student correctly identifies white as the color that would ""reflect the most light"" and that the average temperature on the white lid was lower than the others. However, the description of the impact on the doghouse is more focused on the potential harm of too high an inside temperature rather than discussing how the chosen color would affect the temperature and then connecting that effect to the comfort of the dog. Moreover, the claim about white reflecting the most light, although a reasonable principle, is not directly supported by the data from the experiment, which does not include variables related to light reflection but rather measures air temperature. Therefore, the explanation about the color affecting the inside of the doghouse, while not entirely incorrect, lacks the depth and detail required for a 2-point response, which necessitates both choosing a color and providing a detailed description that includes how the color affects the doghouse, as indicated by the experimental findings."
26641,10,"light gray :: Light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery, making the inside warm for the dog. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy, the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in. Light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy.",1," From the chart, after 10 minutes light gray has 45 temperature units. The black has 53 temperature units, which will be too hot for the dog inside the doghouse.

# Scoring and Rationale:

1

The student response demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard. The student chose a color for the doghouse, described how it would affect the temperature inside, and provided some data from the experiment to support their claim. However, the response lacks a detailed explanation of how the color might affect the inside of the doghouse. 

For a complete answer, the student should describe the trade-offs between light gray paint and other colors. For example, they could compare the advantages of using light gray paint over dark gray or black by considering how the absorbed temperature differs across different lid colors as shown in the table. The answer should provide details on how light gray strikes a balance between absorbing some amount of heat while avoiding extreme temperatures for the dog. For instance, the student could compare light gray temperature of 45C with that of other lid colors as shown in the table (e.g. Black has 53C). This would help in supporting the conclusion that light gray paint is suitable for doghouse with better warmth without getting too hot."
26411,10,black :: i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re.,1," so if the dog is outside and the doghouse is black then the air inside will increase and will not be that cold and be mor e comfatable for the dog. The result on the black is 53 degree and it shows that it is the highest degree.

The student chose black as the most suitable paint color for the doghouse. Furthermore, the student explained that this color would help increase the air temperature inside and keep the dog comfortable. The student supported this explanation with the experiment result which showed the air temperature inside a black-colored container was 53 degrees Celsius, the highest among the options. Therefore, the student should receive a score of 2 based on the given scoring rubric."

# Your Response:


The student response meets the requirements for a score of 2. The student chooses a color (light gray) and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (temperature moderation). The student also uses results from the experiment to support the description, specifically referencing the average temperature of 45 degrees Celsius for the light gray lid. However, the student could have provided a clearer explanation of how the results support their conclusion. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates an understanding of the content standard, and the student is able to apply the experimental results to a practical scenario."
26471,10,white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.,2," the results support this because in the experiment white colored lid had the lowest temperature after ten miniutes of being exposed to the lamp the dog would be safe.


Your Rating: 2

Your Rationale: The student response clearly addresses all three requirements of the prompt: Choosing a paint color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description. Student chose white and describes it as the best option to avoid heat stroke for the dog. Student also referenced the results of the experiment, comparing the average temperatures of white (42°C) to other colors (black=53°C, dark gray=48°C, light gray=45°C) to support the choice. This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the Content Standard, by using the experiment results to justify the chosen solution for the problem."
27027,10,black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.,1," the experiment told us that the darker the color is the more heat it will obtain compared to the lighter color because of the sun.


1.

The student selected black as the color they believe is best for the doghouse exterior, considering the fact that it was the darkest color examined during the experiment and acquired the highest temperature on average (53°C). According to the experiment, the darker the lid color, the greater the air temperature inside the glass jar; if we were to extrapolate to a doghouse, this implies that a doghouse painted a darker shade would be more prone to increased temperature inside. However, the student should have explicitly mentioned the experimental result (average temperature of 53°C) to support their answer. Consequently, they have just partially demonstrated their comprehension of the matter."

Rationale:
The response demonstrates the student has partial understanding of the Content Standard. The student chooses a paint color (""white"") and describes how it might affect the inside of the doghouse (""where you live is hot"" and ""white color would be perfect""). However, the response only mentions the results of the experiment (""the average that is around 42 and 53"") without providing a clear connection to the choice of paint color or its effect inside the doghouse. The student also introduces a different scenario (""paint the doghouse black if you live somewhere cold"") without supporting it with results from the experiment. Therefore, the response deserves 1 point."

The student demonstrated a complete understanding of the Content Standard. The student chose white as the paint color and provided a reason for this choice by stating that it would help keep the doghouse cooler in the summer. The student further supported this choice by providing results from the experiment, specifically mentioning the temperature in the jar (42°C) with the white lid and comparing it to the higher temperatures of the other colors (black, light gray, and dark gray). This demonstrates the ability to describe a reason for choosing a solution and to use results from an experiment to support that description. Additionally, the student even went through a thought process rejecting black as an option and reinforcing the choice of white for the doghouse, making the answer more convincing."
26628,10,light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8(DEG) and it was 3(DEG) hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter,2,". It was the best of both worlds.

Here is the rationale: The student chooses a color -- ""light gray"" -- and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse -- ""would allow the dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter."" The student also uses results from the experiment to support the description -- ""cooler than black by 8(DEG)"" and "" 3(DEG) hotter than white."" However, the student did not explain the meaning of the differences in temperature in relation to the design of the doghouse, which leads to partial understanding of the Content Standard. Therefore, this response scores at the 1-point level instead of 2.

After your feedback on this one please grade the revised version of the student response, which attempts to address your initial concerns.

# Rationale:
The student's response demonstrates a minimal understanding of the task. Although the student chooses a color, ""white,"" and attempts to describe how it might affect the inside of the doghouse, the explanation is brief and lacks clarity. Moreover, the use of experimental results is limited to a single sentence stating that ""it was prooven on the chart"" and mentioning the temperature ""42"" without adequately explaining what this value signifies or how it supports their choice. The response fails to effectively incorporate the experimental findings to justify the selection of the paint color, leading to a score of 0."

Rationale: The response chooses a color, describes how it might affect the inside of the doghouse, and uses data from the experiment to support its claim. However, the description of how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse is present but basic (‘warmest because it will absorb the most heat’) leaving out other essential details. The response meets most of the required task elements. The missing pieces are tied to partial understanding of the description of how that paint color might affect the inside of the doghouse.

# Rationale

The student chooses a color, white, as their recommendation for the doghouse and describes how that color affects the inside of the doghouse (cooler on a hot day). However, the student only partially incorporates results from the experiment by stating that white is the coolest color without explaining or relating the recorded temperatures (42° C for white and 53° C for black after 10 minutes) to support their recommendation. The response lacks a detailed connection to the experimental data, specifically how the temperature differences between the colors inform their choice. The student's claim that a black doghouse could result in a dog's death is also not supported by evidence from the experiment. Overall, the student demonstrates partial understanding of the Content Standard by choosing a color and describing its potential impact but falls short in providing adequate evidence from the experiment to fully support their description."

Rating: 2

Rationale: This response indicates that the student has used the results from the experiment to describe the best paint color for the doghouse by choosing white as it affects the inside of the doghouse with the least temperature. The student also demonstrates an understanding of how white paint will keep the doghouse cooler in the daytime. They have also cited the results of the experiment to support their conclusion by noting that the black lid had the highest temperature. Though the student made minor writing errors, it does not affect their understanding of the topic. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 2."

# Grading Time

Rating: 1

Rationale: The response chooses a color (light gray) and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (it would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days and fall days when it would turn dark); however, the response is missing evidence from the experiment that directly supports this description of the color's effect. It includes results from the experiment, such as 42 °C - 24 °C, but the results referenced are actually for the white lid, not light gray, so this does not directly support the response's claim for light gray. Overall, the student has partial understanding of the content standard."
26019,10,"white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.",2," White tends to make colors be reflected away . Also you think it is dark outside during the summer it does get bright inside a dogs house even with no windows the sun always falls on somethings which is made brighter by the sun. it would be good not to make the doghouse hotter inside because of the dog fur which makes  even hotter. dogs get dehydrated when they pant. So for a cooler temp white is the best color. the dog can lay down without always pant.

# Rationale

This response earned a score of 2 because it demonstrated a complete understanding of the content standard. The student chose white as the best paint color for the doghouse, clearly explaining that this color will help keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because it does not absorb light. They used results from the experiment to support this description, citing the finding that the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature. Furthermore, the student demonstrated a clear understanding of the practical implications of this choice, explaining that a cooler doghouse is important for the health and comfort of the dog, especially given the added heat from the dog's fur.

Rationale: The student's answer demonstrates partial understanding of the Content Standard.  The student chooses a paint color, white, and mentions the effect which suggests the color might affect the inside of the doghouse. However, the student doesn't explicitly describe the relationship between the paint color and the effect on the inside of the doghouse, and more importantly, doesn't explain why the chosen color's attribute leads to the specific effect according to the experiment results, merely listing a fact from the experiment. They only mentioned that white is best because it is not too hot. It does not discuss how the cool temperature relates to the doghouse.

## Step 1: Identify the key components of the scoring rubric.
To assess the student's response, we need to identify if the response chooses a paint color, describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and uses results from the experiment to support the description.

## Step 2: Determine if the student chose a paint color.
The student chose light gray as the paint color for the doghouse.

## Step 3: Assess if the student described how the chosen color might affect the inside of the doghouse.
The student described that a light gray color could provide less heat in the summer but some warmth during the winter, indicating an understanding of how the color might affect the inside of the doghouse.

## Step 4: Evaluate if the student used results from the experiment to support the description.
The student mentioned the experiment, noting that the black lid would get the most heat, and used this information to justify the choice of light gray, suggesting it would provide ""just enough"" heat without being too hot.

## Step 5: Apply the scoring rubric based on the assessment.
Since the student's response chooses a color, describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and uses results from the experiment to support the description, it meets the criteria for a 2-point response.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
26998,10,white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.,1," we did an expriment with white and the temp was less higher compared to the black and gray lid. the white lid temp was the lowest compared to the others. The white color would cool the interior of the doghouse the most.

2 (Two) 

Rationale: This student's response fully meets the expectations of the rubric. The student has chosen a paint color - white - in their doghouse design and has clearly described how it would affect the interior of the doghouse. To support their choice, they referenced the experiment where the white lid resulted in the lowest temperature compared to the other colors. This indicates a clear understanding of the principle that the color of the doghouse will impact the inside temperature, and using the results from the experiment to inform their design choice.

# Rating: 2

This response deserves a 2-point rating because it addresses the question by choosing a paint color, dark gray, and describing its potential effects on the doghouse's interior. It notes that dark gray absorbs more heat than lighter colors, making the doghouse warmer but not excessively so, which demonstrates a clear understanding of the experiment's results. The response also provides additional consideration by mentioning the dog's hair type and suggesting an alternative option with mixed colors to accommodate the dog's temperature preferences. This level of thoughtfulness and utilization of experimental data supports a 2-point rating according to the provided rubric."

## Step 1: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
The student response chooses a color (black) and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (holding in heat so the dog won't get cold). Additionally, the response uses results from the experiment to support the description (the chart ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar"" shows black had the highest temperature).

## Step 2: Assess the completeness of the response.
The response meets all the requirements for a 2-point score: choosing a color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

# Rationale

The student has partially addressed the prompt. Based on their choice of color (black) for the doghouse and their statement that it will keep the dog warmer, the student has included how the color will affect the inside of the doghouse. Also, the student provided data from the experiment to compare the average temperature between black and white lids (53 degrees Celsius vs 42 degrees Celsius), hence using results from the experiment. However, to support a complete description for the best paint color using results from the experiment, additional data analysis is expected to explain why black is the best choice compared to dark grey or light grey that could also provide adequate warmth."

The student failed to describe how the color black might affect the inside of the doghouse.

# Step 3: Verify if the student used results from the experiment to support their description.
The student did not use results from the experiment to support their description.

# Step 4: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
Since the student chose a color but failed to describe how the color might affect the inside of the doghouse and did not use results from the experiment, the student demonstrated partial understanding of the Content Standard.


The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Rationale: The student chose black as the paint color but failed to describe how the color might affect the inside of the doghouse and did not use results from the experiment. Therefore, the student demonstrated partial understanding of the Content Standard, which aligns with a score of 1 point according to the scoring rubric."

# Rating: 0



Now, your reason for the rating is expected here. Here is why I gave a 0. It looks like the response indicates that the black color would negatively affect the doghouse. The student is aware of this, having demonstrated the understanding, but fails to choose a better color. Hence, the student's understanding in not fully correct since the student failed to use the results from the experiment to support a solution to a situation -- choosing a color to paint a doghouse that won't get too hot for the dog."

This response demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard. The student chose a color and mentioned that it would cool down the temperature inside the doghouse, but they failed to elaborate on how this color might affect the inside of the doghouse. While they did mention the results of the experiment, their statement was very general (""white is cooler than the rest of the colors"") and did not provide specific data from the experiment to support their description. For example, the student could have mentioned the average air temperature for the white lid (42°C) and compared it to the other colors to support their claim."

The response partially understands the concept and chooses a color that might be suitable for a doghouse. The response correctly identifies that white color would keep the doghouse cool, which aligns with the results from the experiment demonstrating that the white lid resulted in the lowest average temperature. The response does compare the white lid's temperature to the black lid, but fails to explain how a lower temperature inside the doghouse would affect the dog other than stating cooler is more comfortable for the dog without further explanation. The description is missing further elaboration of why keeping a doghouse cool is beneficial for the dog. Therefore, it merits 1 point, not 2."

This response does not clearly earn a perfect score because of poor description on how the chosen paint color might affect the inside of the doghouse. While the student is able to choose a color, partially explain how it might make the doghouse hotter,  and provide results from the experiment to support the choice, the description does not provide thorough details. The description only states that the color ""will make it hotter,"" but it is unclear how this color would be superior to the other color lid options. Additionally, the student deviates from the original experiment and mentions installing windows or a sunblock, which is not part of the original experiment to choose a superior paint color."

# Rationale: 
Student's response demonstrates an understanding of the Content Standard. They use the results from the experiment to describe the best paint color for the doghouse. They chose dark gray as the color and provided a brief description of how it would not be too hot inside the doghouse. Furthermore, the student used the data from the experiment to rationalize that black would be too hot and white would be too cold, thus showing the thought process behind their choice of dark gray. This supports the description of the chosen color and satisfies the conditions required for a two-point response."

# Grader Response:

The student was given a score of $1$ out of $2$.

Rationale:
The student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the content standard. The student has chosen a paint color and included results from the experiment. However, the student did not describe the positive effect of the chosen color on the inside of the doghouse. The response indicates the white doghouse would be colder, implying that it would be better to prevent the dog from getting too hot. But this is the extent of the response.  The response doesn't fully consider what would be best for the doghouse or why. Therefore, the student has earned a point of 1 out of 2."

# Rationale: 

The response chooses a color for the doghouse, in this case, light gray, and also describes its effect on the inside of the doghouse, mentioning that it absorbs enough heat but not too much to be hot or cold. Additionally, the response effectively uses the results from the experiment to support the description, providing temperature values for different colors, indicating that light gray is a suitable choice. Therefore, this demonstrates a complete understanding of the task and meets the requirements to score 2 points."
26478,10,light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.,1," it will heat the air inside


## Step 1: Review the Student Response
The student has chosen the color ""light gray"" for the doghouse and mentions that it will heat the doghouse so it is warm and not too hot or too cold. They reference the data, stating that the light gray color was ""just about the middle"" in terms of heating the air inside.

## Step 2: Apply the Scoring Rubric
According to the scoring rubric, a 2-point response requires the student to choose a color, describe how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and use results from the experiment to support the description. The student has partially met these requirements by choosing a color and referencing the data. However, their description of how the color might affect the inside of the doghouse is somewhat vague.

## Step 3: Determine the Score
Given that the student has demonstrated some understanding of the Content Standard by choosing a color and referencing the data, but has not fully met the requirements for a 2-point response, the score should be 1 point.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"

Please rate the response based on the scoring rubric. 

Rating: 
2

Reasoning:
The response received a rating of 2 because it successfully describes why light gray is the best paint color for a doghouse using both experimental data and considerations of the potential environmental conditions outside. In particular, the student noted that, while the light gray attracted some warmth, it avoided both the extreme temperatures that the black and white surfaces experienced. By choosing the moderate temperature of light gray and providing evidence from the experiment (average temperature values for each color), the response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the experiment and effectively applies the findings to the design problem posed."

The response demonstrates partial understanding of the Content Standard, as the student chose a paint color (light gray) and provided a brief description of how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""in the summer the dog house will not be hot dog not get stressed out""). However, the response fails to include results from the experiment to support the description, which is a required component to achieve a score of 2. Although the student chose a paint color and described its potential effects, the lack of experimental evidence to justify their choice precludes a perfect score."

**Rating: 1**
The student has partial understanding of the problem. They have chosen a color, ""black"". However, their description and utilization of the results of the experiment are minimal. In their statement ""The other colors had between 40 and 50 DEG but black is hotter than the other colors,"" they acknowledge the difference in the temperature, but the statement ""So black might really heat up the inside of the doghouse on a hot day"" shows a limited use of data to analyze the effect of color on the doghouse's temperature. Their description is missing concrete details on how black color might affect the inside of the doghouse, supported by experiment data."

Also because the light gray tempatures change so much.

Rationale:

The score here is 0.

The response attempts to rationalize the choice of color using the experimental data, but does not accurately interpret the results. It is stated that dark gray is the best choice because the temperature remains ""the same every single time"", which is incorrect, and it is implied that dark gray is the ""middle"" option that remains stable under different temperature conditions, which is also incorrect. Additionally, the response misinterprets the results regarding light gray and black.

A better answer would have provided an accurate description of how dark gray affected the inside temperature of the jar, by comparing the results of the experiment for all four colors, and explaining how that would influence the inside of the doghouse."

The student response chose white as the color for the doghouse and explained how that color would affect the inside of the doghouse by saying it would not get too hot because it reflects light. The student also used the experiment results to support their description by comparing the temperatures recorded for white and black. The rationale for the score of 1 is for the response to receive a higher grade, the student needs to do two things: The answer must choose a color and second be able to describe how the color might affect the inside of the dog house also a description of the experiment results and the student only described how white and black might affect the inside of the dog house.

That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.,2," The white lid would have a better effect then the black lid to cool off the doghouse. Since it only takes a max of five seconds for dogs to overheat in a doghouse, even 9 degrees less than white makes a large difference.

# Rationale
The response demonstrates the student has partial understanding of the Content Standard. The student chooses a color, black, and mentions that the results show black ""is the hottest color."" But the response fails to clearly describe how the chosen color might affect the inside of the doghouse in context. For instance, while it mentions ""the doghouse would be extremely hot,"" it does not connect this directly to the experimental results (an increase of 29°C) or consider what this means in terms of the dog's comfort during less extreme conditions.

The student response, although not complete, demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard. The student chooses a color, dark gray, and describes how it might affect the inside of the doghouse, by reasoning that it will not get too hot or cold due to its moderate light-reflecting properties. However, the student does not explicitly use results from the experiment to support their description, simply mentioning the color temperatures of white and black without explaining how those results led to their choice of dark gray. Therefore, the response scores 1 point, showing partial understanding but missing the clear connection to experimental results."

## Step 1: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.
The student response chooses a color (black) and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (the air temperature would shoot up). The student also uses results from the experiment to support the description (the highest scores after 10 minutes in the glass bottle).

## Step 2: Evaluate the completeness of the response.
The response includes all required components: choosing a paint color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description.

## Step 3: Assess the understanding of the Content Standard.
The student demonstrates an understanding of the Content Standard by applying the results of the experiment to a real-world problem (designing a doghouse) and considering the potential effects of the chosen color on the inside of the doghouse.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

# Rationale

The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the Content Standard. They choose the paint color ""white"" and provide a logical rationale for its potential impact on the inside of the doghouse, stating that it would keep the doghouse cooler by reflecting light. The student also explicitly cites the experiment's results, mentioning the average temperature of 42°C observed with the white lid and contrasting it with the behavior of dark colors. They further apply these experimental findings to a real-world scenario, emphasizing the benefits of white paint for maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the doghouse. Overall, the student's description of the best paint color for the doghouse, along with their justification and use of experimental results, meets all the criteria outlined in the scoring rubric for a 2-point response."

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response to see if it meets the criteria for a full score.
The student chose a color (white), described how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""it would be cooler on the inside of the house""), and provided a reasoning based on the principles of the experiment (""if its a dark color it would attract more energy/heat"").

## Step 3: Determine if the student's response provides results from the experiment to support the description.
The student implies an understanding of the experiment's findings by mentioning that dark colors attract more energy/heat, which is in line with the experiment's results. However, they do not explicitly mention the results from the experiment to support their choice of white as the best color.

## Step 4: Based on the analysis, decide on a score.
Given that the student's response chooses a color, describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, but does not explicitly use results from the experiment to support the description, the response demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"

# Rationale:

The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard. While the student chooses a color (light gray), and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (by providing a certain brightness and coolness level suitable for the dog), there is a lack of a clear explanation of how the experiment results support the choice. The student mentions the results from the experiment by stating that the light gray color gave a medium temperature point, but this explanation is somewhat vague. Also, no clear connection is made to what is meant by ""medium point"" in the context of how it benefits the dog in the doghouse beyond that it would keep the dog neither too warm nor too cold. Therefore, the response was assigned a score of 1."

The student demonstrates a thorough understanding of the content standard by providing a well-supported explanation for their choice of paint color for the doghouse. They choose the color white, accurately stating that it resulted in the lowest average temperature in the experiment (42 degrees Celsius). The student also provides a clear explanation of how the color affects the inside of the doghouse, stating that white does not attract as much heat, which will keep the dog cool. By directly referencing the experiment results to support their description, the student meets all the requirements for a 2-point response, showcasing their ability to use evidence to justify their design decision."

1. The student response demonstrates partial understanding of the Content Standard. The student response describes the best paint color for the doghouse by choosing the color white and describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""White, because you want your dog to be cool enough...""). However, it uses limited results from the experiment to support the description (""according to the 'Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar' chart, white is the coolest""). The student response shows that the student is unable to expand upon the provided results of the experiment and relate it to the potential impact of the paint color on the doghouse. Therefore, the response warrants a score of 1."

This student chose a color (black) and described how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""it won't effect inside the dog house. since it has the most temperature it will keep dog house warm during winter""). However, the student failed to correctly use the results from the experiment to support the description. The response inaccurately states that the sun won't reflect the color black (when in fact, the experiment suggests that darker colors absorb more energy, causing a higher temperature increase). While the student references the higher temperature of the black lid in the experiment, they fail to accurately connect this result to the choice of black as the best paint color. Therefore, the student does not fully demonstrate the required understanding of the Content Standard, earning a score of 1."

# Grading:


Please rate the response according to the rubric and write a rationale for your rating.

The score for this student's response is: **2**

Rationale: In their response, the student has used the results from the experiment to choose a paint color for the doghouse (dark gray). This color might affect the inside of the doghouse in that it will ""stay cool but also collect heat,"" suggesting that the dark gray paint color maintains an appropriate and comfortable temperature. Moreover, the student uses findings from the experiment to support their choice (""in the experiment, the dark gray got up to 48°C""), and opines that this temperature is ""very comfortable"" inside the doghouse. Thus, the student response fully meets the requirements laid out by the APPE and in the item specifications as they pick a solution (dark gray color) for a problem (how best to paint the doghouse with respect to its inside temperature) as well as justify their selection by using the data for describing a key feature (temperature inside the doghouse).

The white did not raise much above the starting point showing that it would be cold in the cooler seasons. And the black lid increased by a whole 29 degrees, showing that the doghouse would be too warm in the warmer seasons. All in all the light gray lid fits the needs of the perfect dog house, for its ability to maintain a level temperature.


# Use the above rubric to score this response


2

The response demonstrates the student understands the Content Standard. The response describes light gray as the best color option for painting the doghouse because it will maintain a comfortable temperature inside in all seasons. This response meets the full requirements of the rubric, as it chooses a color, describes how the color affects the inside of the doghouse, and uses results from the experiment to support the description. The student references specific temperatures and their increases (or lack thereof) as discussed in the experiment to support claims about the potential effects of different colors."

The student chose a paint color, light gray, for the doghouse and appropriately justified their choice by considering both summer and winter conditions. They explained that a light gray doghouse will maintain a moderate temperature in both seasons, not too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter. The student also supported their choice with evidence from the experiment by discussing the temperature averages for the white (42°C), black (53°C), and dark gray (48°C) lids, which demonstrates that light gray would indeed yield a middle ground in temperatures. Therefore, the student fully addressed the problem by choosing a color, describing its effect on the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support their description."

## Step 1: Identify the key components of the scoring rubric
To assess the student's response, we need to identify if it meets the criteria for a 2-point, 1-point, or 0-point response according to the scoring rubric. The key components are choosing a paint color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description.

## Step 2: Evaluate the student's response against the rubric
The student's response chooses a color (white), describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler""), and uses results from the experiment to support the description (""in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coolest with a white one... it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher"").

The student selected and named a color (white), explained how that color affects the inside of the doghouse (""the doghouse will stay cooler""), and supported the answer using results from the experiment (""After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference""). Additionally, the student further explained why this is the case by making a connection to real-life examples (""most of the houses in Arizona have light colored roofs"").

## Step 1: Analyze the student's response to determine if it meets the requirements for a score of 2.
The student chose a color, black, and described how it might affect the inside of the doghouse by making it warmer when the sun is out. The student also used results from the experiment to support the description, stating that black absorbed more energy and rose to the highest temperature.

## Step 2: Determine if the student's response is missing any key components required for a score of 2.
The student's response includes all the necessary components: choosing a color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description.

## Step 3: Decide on a score based on the analysis.
Since the student's response meets all the requirements for a score of 2, it demonstrates a clear understanding of the Content Standard.

Because the experimental data suggests that painting the doghouse black will increase the inside temperature inside the doghouse more than any other color, and, if the doghouse is hotter inside than outside, the temperature will result in a warm environment for the dog. This is because the temperatures of the black lid rose 29° above the starting temperature whereas the other colors, the lighter colors, would not create as big of a difference in temperature.

# Response

The rationale for a score of 0 might be misleading at first sight because the student seemed to provide a good description of how the color black might affect the inside of the doghouse, and uses results from the experiment to support the description by explaining the rise in temperature.  However, a closer inspection of the student response will reveal that the logic is flawed because a difference in temperature inside and outside the doghouse does not necessarily mean that the doghouse will be warmer *than is ideal for the dog.* In fact, in many places a difference of 29° above outside temperature can be very bad for the dog. In short, there was no consideration of what constitutes a warm or a good environment for the dog. The student's response was as if the question was asking to show that there is a correlation between the color of the lid and the air temperature inside, which was shown to be indeed positive. But the question was more complex than that because it asked the student to apply the results to a real world scenario (e.g. the doghouse), and in this respect the student's response was not good. Because the student failed to consider the broader context, the response is rated as 0."

The student chose a paint color (black) and described how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse. They included some anecdotal evidence, such as wearing a black shirt outside, to support their claim that black colors can absorb solar energy and warm up. The student also included some data from the experiment to support their claim. However, the data was presented in a simplistic manner without much analysis or interpretation. Also, there is no clear explanation of the relationship between the data and the student's claim that black color will keep the dog warm in the winter. Additionally, the sentence ""As you can see in the data Black is the best with 54,52,54 temperature"" does not show how this relates to the doghouse temperature, especially since it started at 24° C. Therefore, while the student has demonstrated some understanding of the content, they have not fully demonstrated a 2-point understanding.

## Step 1: Assess the student's understanding of the Content Standard based on the provided response.
The student has chosen a paint color (black) and described how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse. They also included some data from the experiment to support their claim.

## Step 2: Determine if the student's response meets the criteria for a 2-point response as defined by the scoring rubric.
The student's response does not fully meet the criteria for a 2-point response because, while they chose a color and included results from the experiment, the description of how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse lacks a clear explanation of the relationship between the data and the student's claim.

## Step 3: Decide if the student's response aligns more closely with the criteria for a 1-point or 0-point response.
Given that the student has demonstrated some understanding of the content by choosing a color, describing its potential effect, and referencing experimental data, their response is more aligned with the criteria for a 1-point response.

The student has chosen light gray as the color and written that the temperature will only rise by 21 degrees. However, they did not provide the correct way that the color might affect the inside of the doghouse based on the experiment results correctly. Additionally, their usage of the results from the experiment has errors in their explanation. Specifically, the student writes that light gray will only raise the temperature by 21 degrees, which seems incorrect given the experimental results provided where the starting temperature was 24° C and in the experiment, after 10 minutes, the average air temperature under the light gray lid is 45° C. This corresponds to a 21° C increase, but it isn't clear from the student's phrasing that they used this information in choosing light gray or in discussing how black compares to light gray accurately based on the experiment. Furthermore, their rationale for selecting the color was not adequately supported. The student did not follow all the directions, since they did not clearly describe why they chose light gray and did not provide correct evidence from the experiment in choosing that particular color. Based on the Science eighth-grade exam rubric, a 0-point response demonstrates the student has little or no understanding of the Content Standard."

The student chose a color and described how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse. However, the response lacks supporting evidence from the experiment to justify why the chosen temperature is ""perfect"" for a dog. This suggests the student has partial understanding of the Content Standard.  The student seems to focus more on dog’s comfort, in the context of temperatures in the winter and the summer, rather than directly linking results of experiment--i.e., why 45°C can serve as ideal temperature for a dog in the doghouse.  Therefore, a 1-point response seems appropriate. 
````
### Step 1: Analyze the student's response to identify the key components.
The student chose the color light gray and described how it might affect the inside of the doghouse by stating it won't get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.

### Step 2: Evaluate if the student used results from the experiment to support their description.
The student mentioned the temperature of the light gray lid was 45 degrees after being under the lamp for 10 minutes but failed to directly link this result to why it's ""perfect"" for a dog, lacking a clear connection to the experimental data.

### Step 3: Apply the scoring rubric based on the analysis.

If it was black and 28/29 outside. the temp would be 78C inside the doghouse. that would be too hot for the dog.



# Your Response:

## Step 1: Review the scoring rubric to understand the criteria for evaluating the student's response.
The scoring rubric requires the student to choose a paint color for the doghouse, describe how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and use results from the experiment to support the description.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response to determine if they have met the criteria.
The student chose white as the best paint color for the doghouse, describing that it will keep the doghouse cooler compared to darker colors. They used results from the experiment, citing the temperature difference between the black and white lids to support their description.

## Step 3: Evaluate the student's understanding of the experiment's results and their application to the problem.
The student correctly interpreted the data from the experiment, noting that the white lid resulted in a lower temperature inside the jar compared to the black lid. They applied this understanding to a real-world scenario, considering how the paint color would affect the inside of the doghouse.

## Step 4: Determine the score based on the student's response.
Given that the student chose a color, described how it would affect the inside of the doghouse, and used results from the experiment to support their description, their response meets all the criteria outlined in the scoring rubric for a 2-point response.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.",2," Black might be a good color because in a warmer doghouse it would keep the dog warm at night.


# Rating:


# Rationale:


RATING=2

The student selects black as the paint color for the doghouse and justifies this choice by explaining that it might make the doghouse warmer than using a lighter color like white, providing a specific average temperature from the experiment (53 degrees) to support this claim. The student also uses a comparison to provide further support, stating that the temperature difference between black and white is 11 degrees. Furthermore, the response concludes that a warmer doghouse would be desirable, as it would keep the dog warm at night, which shows an understanding of how the design of the doghouse could impact its intended user. By meeting both criteria, selecting a color and using results from the experiment to support their reasoning, the response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the task and is therefore rated 2 points."

# Rating: 2

# Rationale: 

This response chooses a color for the doghouse and describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse. Additionally, the response uses results from the experiment to support the description. The response chooses the black color because it showed the highest temperature, 53°C, in the experiment. This indicates an understanding of how the experimental results can inform a design decision about the doghouse. The response also mentions a possible disadvantage of using black paint, indicating an awareness of the potential trade-offs in the design process. Overall, this response demonstrates an understanding of the content standard and effectively uses the experimental results to justify the choice of paint color."

Answer:

Score: 2


Rationale: 

You chose the color white for the doghouse. However, the reason why you chose white is not clear. White was the coolest of all the colors tested in the experiment. The average air temperature in the jar was 42° C. In the description of how the color might affect the doghouse, you should state something like this - The inside of the doghouse will be cooler than if it were painted with a darker color. This is because the average temperature measured inside the jar when covered with a white lid was less than when the lid was black, dark gray, or light gray. Although your answer contained the right information, your explanation could be clearer. For example, you could say that in the experiment white results in lower temperatures in comparison with darker colors and therefore would be a great choice for the dog-house color in warm climates.

26302,10,white ::  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. And th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar,1,". :::: however that wold make it way to hot. White is the best color because white would absord the heat and also it would be a bright color to paint so the doghouse dont get to hold and the temputure inside is very small

The student response starts by choosing two colors, but ultimately settles on white, correctly describing the benefits of this color choice for the temperature inside the doghouse. Although the response contains some errors in reasoning and syntax, it adequately uses results from the experiment, stating that darker colors absorb more heat and produce higher temperatures. This serves as a basis for eliminating black and choosing white to prevent excessive heat in the doghouse. Therefore, this response demonstrates understanding of the content standard."

The student response contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which are not necessarily a concern for the scoring rubric. However, the response does attempt to address the question, albeit in a limited and flawed manner. The response simply selects ""white"" as the best color for the doghouse and mentions that it would make the doghouse ""cooler"" compared to the black lid. Although the response does provide some experimental results, it fails to provide a clear and coherent description of how the color might affect the inside of the doghouse beyond simply stating that it will be ""cooler"". Furthermore, the response includes unclear and irrelevant statements about dog safety, which diverts from the main question of why the color was chosen. While the response has some elements of the correct answer, the lack of a clear and coherent explanation ultimately makes it a 0-point response."

## Step 1: Review the scoring rubric to understand the criteria for rating the student's response.
The scoring rubric requires that a 2-point response demonstrates an understanding of the Content Standard by choosing a paint color, describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, and using results from the experiment to support the description.

## Step 2: Evaluate the student's response to see if it meets the criteria for a 2-point response.
The student's response chooses a color (white), describes how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse (""keep the inside temp a little bit cooler""), but does not explicitly use results from the experiment to support the description. The response mentions ""lighter colors reflect light,"" which is a general principle but does not directly reference the experiment's data.

## Step 3: Consider if the response meets the criteria for a 1-point response.
The response demonstrates a partial understanding of the Content Standard by choosing a color and describing how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse. However, it lacks the direct use of results from the experiment to support the description, which aligns with the criteria for a 1-point response.

## Step 4: Based on the evaluation, determine the score for the student's response.
Given the information provided and the criteria outlined in the scoring rubric, the student's response most closely aligns with the criteria for a 1-point response.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"

The student response correctly uses the experimental results, such as comparison of the average temperatures of black and white, to support the paint color choice, meeting both conditions of choosing a color and using results. Additionally, the response provides a description of how the chosen color might affect the inside of the doghouse - keeping it warm for the dog, showing an understanding of the problem that the technological design process is intended to solve."

The student has provided some comparison data, such as the white paint staying 18 degrees colder than the starting temperature (compared to black, at 54 degrees), and has partially explained how the white color might affect the inside of the doghouse (kept cooler). The reasoning falls under 1 point (1 point) because it lacks a specific reference to the results of the experiment for the white color (the student wrote incorrectly that it was 18 degrees colder; it is actually 42 degrees average temperature after 10 minutes).

The correct analysis should use the results from the experiment to support the answer, explaining that the white color stayed closer to the starting temperature, which is more accurate evidence to support the description of it keeping cooler. Thus, a full understanding of the Content Standard’s requirement to choose a color, describe its effects, and use experimental results to support that description is not provided. Based on the scoring rubric requirements for full marks, the response does not align with receiving 2 points but meets some criteria worthy of 1 point. So, it is rated 1. I am sorry I provided the rationale for score 1.

The revised answer should be 
1

The student has chosen a color, white, and provided a description of how that color might affect the inside of the doghouse, mentioning it would stay cool. Although the student attempted to use the results from the experiment, incorrectly stating that it was 18 degrees colder for the white paint, the actual analysis using experimental data for the white color is incorrect and does not accurately apply the given data. Therefore, the student response is rated 1 for partially achieving the content standard requirements as it provided a description but lacked accurate support from the experimental results."
