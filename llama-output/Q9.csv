The response provided by the student does not fulfill the requirements of the task. The student is asked to describe how the author organizes the article, but the student's response mainly focuses on the content of the article instead of its organization. Although the student mentions the beginning of the story and a specific event involving an astronaut and a tool bag on the ISS, these details are mentioned in isolation without any analysis of how they fit into the broader organizational structure of the article. Furthermore, the student's response is incomplete, as it ends with uncertainty about how to complete the assignment. This suggests a lack of understanding of the task requirements. Therefore, the response does not demonstrate any proficiency in analyzing the organization of the article, warranting a score of 0 points according to the provided rubric.

23172,9,"The author opens the article with a introduction to get the readers attention, and then he gives a third paragraph to keep the readers attention and tell them what's coming. After this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections, 'What Is Space Junk?'

Even though this isn't the best way to write an article, it works and helps us get an understanding of space junk.


# Rating and Rationale:

The student provides an adequate analysis of the organizational structure of the article. The student identifies the introductory paragraph (""Grab your telescope!""), notes the transitional paragraph (""What happens...""), and accurately names and describes the purpose of the subsequent sections (""What Is Space Junk?"", ""Crash Course,"" and ""Little Bits, But a Big Deal""). Although the student does not describe the specific transitions or connections between the sections, the student shows an understanding of the overall organization of the article and how it contributes to the author's purpose. Additionally, the student acknowledges the conclusion's role in leaving the reader with a lasting impression. The student's minor criticisms of the article's organization do not detract from the accuracy of their analysis. Therefore, a score of 2 is warranted."

The student correctly identifies that the article presents the topic of ""Space Junk"" before explaining what the term means. The student also notes that the author transitions smoothly to describing the effects of ""Space Junk"" in space. The student points out the use of categories or headings within the text to support the idea that the author organized the article effectively. Overall, the response presents text-based evidence to support the student's claim about organization throughout the article.

They gave different statistics about the various parts of space junk, that was addressed.",2," This allowed the reader to get an understanding of the topics, such as what space junk is and how it can affect society, that were being discussed. The author starts by defining space junk then goes on from there with each of the other topics. It also had transitional phrases to connect ideas, for the reader, making it easy to understand. There isn't just one theme but many, and many supporting facts. Because the text provides all the information to get a full understanding, it can be considered an expository article. The definition and information explain, and expound on what, where, and how of the given information.

# Answer:

1

The response states that the text is organized ""in a topical manner"" and lists topics that are included in the text, such as ""the definition of space junk, the danger of dead satellites, and the sizes compared to the danger of the space junk"". This fulfills some of the requirements of the task, but lacks more detailed analysis of the structure of each section, and how each contributes to the whole article. 
A topical manner does not provide the detail necessary to fulfill all the requirements of the task. Although the student identified transitional phrases as support for organization, there is no detailed list. 
Although some specific statistics are mentioned, as ""various parts of space junk, that was addressed,"" the response was only limited to just ""statistics"" without concrete detail, thereby making the student's response ""partially proficient"" as defined by the rubric. Therefore, the student response score is 1."

# Rationale: 

The student partially describes how the author organizes the article but fails to provide sufficient detail. The student notes the article's general beginning and end but does not explain what happens in between or elaborate about how the sections specifically connect to support the overall organization of the article. The student mentions that ""the author talks about the satellites and when they're broken how much of an impact they have on the Earth"" but doesn't explicitly state that this section explains how old satellites become space junk, nor does the student explain how this idea builds upon the first section, which describes the launching of spacecraft. Furthermore, the student's explanation of the final section lacks specifics, not mentioning the cataloging of objects and strategies for lessening damage from microdebris, making the response lacking in thorough support from the text. Overall, the response does not have enough supporting details to fully complete the task."

He wants to get a point across that it is a big deal if satellites crash because they can break down into many little parts and soon come onto earth's surface. If it comes on earth's surface it can harm people's health.,0, He wants us to know the damage is being done in space if a single piece of space hits anything else it causes thousands of other debris in space that also have the ability to break down further. So he just tells us the big picture and then gets us into to the details we need to know about space junk.

And finally, 'Little Bits' which is about how the little debris can do a lot of damage to orbiting satellites.",2," Also the ending explains what we are trying to do to stop this but how it is still a really big problem.


The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$


Rationale: The response provides a clear and complete summary of how the article is organized: an introduction that captures the reader's attention, followed by sections that discuss how space junk arose, describe a specific instance of a collision and the problems caused by minor debris, and finally note the challenges presented by space pollution.

# Rationale 

This rating is given as the student has shown an attempt to discuss the organization or structure of the passage, and there are relevant points raised, such as the use of the introduction to engage the reader and the use of parts to structure the essay. However, the response is described as ""Partially Proficient"" since it contains points that could be considered simplistic and not adequately text-based or explained. The breakdown of the essay into four parts is not especially revealing of the author’s organization and there are areas such as transitions between sections and how author uses specific techniques to link ideas, support a claim, that are not touched upon. Furthermore, much of what the student says lacks specific textual support, which makes it unsatisfactory based on rubric requirements.

The response provides some relevant information about the organization of the article; however, it is missing details and is general. The response mentions the main topics of the author, but it does not explain how these topics fit together or how the author arranged them to build a cohesive text. Also, the student response jumps quickly from the causes of space debris to the dangers of the collision of satellites without mentioning the purpose of the passage between these two topics. Additionally, when stating that the author tried to get the reader to understand that space junk is a big deal, the student uses ""very big deal"" incorrectly, missing the tone and vocabulary with which the author tried to persuade the reader. Overall, the response lacks clarity and textual evidence."

He does it in a good chronological order that makes it seem more like a conversation.


# Rating

1

# Rationale

The student partially explains the organization of the article. He mentions the history of space exploration and the source of space junk, which corresponds to the sections ""What Is Space Junk?"" and ""Little Bits, But a Big Deal?"" in the article. The student also attempts to describe the sequence of ideas in the article by stating that it is done in ""a good chronological order."" However, the response lacks detail and depth to fully demonstrate how the author's ideas are organized, which is why it scores 1 point instead of 2 points. Additionally, the student includes the phrase ""makes it seem more like a conversation,"" which is an interpretation of the text rather than a direct explanation of the organization of the article. More detail and specific examples from the text would strengthen the student's response to demonstrate proficiency."
23629,9,"The author uses subtitles to organize the article.  Before certain paragraphs, at the left-hand side is a bolded subtitle.  For example, before the author gets into defining 'space junk', there is a subtitle labeled 'What Is Space Junk?'  Also, before the author tells about the microdebris in space, there is a title labeled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'",2," These subtitles give a title to each section and let the reader know what each paragraph will be about.

# Answer


1

The response is partially proficient because it does identify the use of subtitles as a tool to organize the article. However, the explanation is somewhat simplistic and does not fully address how the author has organized the article beyond the use of headings. For instance, the student could have elaborated on how each section builds upon the previous one or how the author uses transitions to connect the different parts of the article. Instead, the student focuses primarily on the formatting aspect of the article, providing examples of how the subtitles work but not delving deeper into the author's organizational method. Therefore, while the response is generally correct, it lacks depth and detail, resulting in a score of 1 point."
23536,9,"The author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs. The paragraph titled 'What is Space Junk?', consists of information about what 'Space Junk' actually is.

The author groups his ideas together in order to convey the reader with a better understanding of what the topic 'Space junk' really represents. For example, he groups the consequences into the paragraph headed 'Little bits, But a Big Deal.' The author has an organized flow that makes it easy for the audience to grasp what he is communicating.

The best answer is 2. However, please see below: 
 The best answer is 1.

The student response fulfills some of the requirements of the task, but some of the information may be too general, too simplistic, or not supported by the text. The student partially identifies the correct order of events and ideas but doesn't describe them clearly. Additionally, some sentences appear not to be supported by the text; for instance, ""we could lose one day a man or a woman to space just for that one thing and they dont like to tell them because it could be something sooo samll but also just something so big"" is not mentioned in the passage.

So then, you can tell that he wrote the article to inform others. His other thing is that the little bits make a big difference. The author gives the example of sand grain, paint from a concrete wall, where you take a sand blaster to blast the paint off, and the sand takes the paint with it. This explains that even the tiny parts make a big difference.


# Grade and Rationale:

The response correctly acknowledges that the author presents the article information by segmenting it into different paragraphs, and mentions several key points discussed in the article such as dead satellites, floating junk, and the impact of tiny bits of space debris. However, it lacks detail on the purpose these sections serve within the article and how the organization contributes to the overall message. The student could have been more specific in explaining how each paragraph contributes to the flow of the article. Additionally, the student oversimplifies the information given. For instance, in the statement ""he wrote the article to inform others,"" the student does not specify what others are being informed of. Furthermore, the response has incomplete information and lacks more sophisticated analysis of the article's structure. Therefore, it only partially fulfills the task requirements, making it a Partially Proficient response."

The student's response does not satisfactorily fulfill the requirements of the task. They claim the article is not organized well and is confusing, but their statement is inaccurate and incomplete. The article logically starts with an attention-grabbing paragraph that relates to the main topic ""Orbiting Junk"" before formally defining what space junk is. Although the article introduces a tool bag first, it transitions well to explaining space junk in the subsequent section. The student fails to recognize the clear transitions between sections in the article and does not support their response with relevant text-based details. Thus, the response is marked as Not Proficient."

### Step 1: Evaluate the student's response based on the scoring rubric.
The student's response provides a general overview of the article's organization, mentioning the introduction, the explanation of space junk, and the discussion of the problem's complexity. However, the response lacks specific details from the article to support their claims.

### Step 2: Determine the score based on the evaluation in step 1.
Given that the response fulfills some of the requirements of the task but lacks specific text-based information to support their claims, the score should reflect partial proficiency.

The student provides a general overview of the organization of the article, mentioning the explanation of what space junk is, an example of a crash that caused space junk, and the problems caused by space junk. However, the response lacks specific details and text-based evidence to support the student's claims. For example, the student could have mentioned the specific sections of the article, such as ""What Is Space Junk?"" or ""Crash Course,"" to provide a clearer illustration of the author's organization.

The space junk is created from satellites colliding into each other and creating debris. Finally, the author wraps up the article explaining why space junk possesses a harm to spacecrafts and other objects in space.

The student response partially meets the task expectations. The student correctly identifies some key organizational elements of the text (the use of multiple sections and appropriately fitting section titles, especially with the example of the crash of the US and Russian satellites) and even hints at the use of supporting evidence. However, the details provided are somewhat incomplete and lack a more explicit analysis of the article's structure and the connections between its components. For example, the response could have further explored how the sections are organized or connected to support the article's central idea about space junk. 

Overall, the student’s response demonstrates some understanding of the organizational features of the text, but lacks more comprehensive explanation and evidence to support their claims fully. Hence, a score of 1 is awarded."

The passage is concluded by explaining how important the topic of space junk is.",2," Then the reader is told how some people might think that space junk is a problem, but really it is very serious to them. They are given a comparison to something that the reader can understand. The author then tells us that the problem is hard to solve and that there will be more of it, and in fact space agencies are looking for help from commercial people and other nations. That is the way the author organizes this article.

Rationale
The response provides a general idea of the organizational pattern of the article but lacks specific details to support the points made. The student states that the author begins by grabbing the reader’s attention with ""statements with exclamation points and giving a little information."" The student could have supported this point by quoting, for example, the first line of the passage: ""Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!"" However, the student never provides a specific detail to show how the author ""goes on to explain exactly what space junk is."" Although the student is accurate in noting the author’s conclusion about the importance of the topic, the explanation is vague because it lacks specific text evidence. In general, the response fulfills some requirements of the task but falls short in supporting the points made with specific text evidence. The student should be able to state the organization pattern explicitly and use specific examples from the text to verify the statements."

# The explanation should follow below without any heading
The student presents an attempt at organizing the article into categories, which suggests an understanding of the task. However, the execution falls short of being fully proficient. The student's explanation is somewhat incoherent, with sentences that are hard to follow and lacking clear connections to the text. For instance, the mention of ""The Soviet Union"" seems out of place in multiple categories without clearly articulating its relevance to each section. Furthermore, the table provided is more of a listing of events rather than a clear demonstration of how the article is structured, lacking clarity in defining what each category represents. While there are elements that show"
23956,9,The author starts out by explaining how the space junk got into the Earth's orbit. Then he explains the dangers that a little piece could cause on a spaceship. Then he explains how much space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is on the rise.,1," The author goes back and forth on what's causing the debris and what problems it causes. Finally the author tells about what the world is doing to try and stop it. They have NASA and the European Space Agency to keep track of objects. They also have a lost tool bag, for example, is listed as Satellite 33442. The author explains what the different levels are doing, but does not tell how to help stop it.

# Grading

The student provides a clear overview of how the author structured the passage and presents multiple instances to support that perspective. Despite the fact that the analysis could have been more profound, the pupil delivers a well-organized and well-supported critique of the author's organizational strategy. The response fulfills all the requirements of the task.

Then they place supportive evidence in the article and give the facts with clear and important information. So this helps organize the material and gives each idea space to be thought of on its own.


# Rating: 2

# Rationale: 

The student's response fulfills all the requirements of the task by demonstrating a clear understanding of the author's organization of the article. They identify the use of subheadings and the arrangement of ideas as organizational tools, and acknowledge the importance of supportive evidence and clear presentation of information. The response is text-based and relevant to the task. Although the student could provide more specific examples of the supportive evidence and subheadings used by the author, their overall assessment of the organization of the article is accurate and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
23367,9,The author organizes this article by putting the least important first and the most important topic last. The author first started talking about space junk. Then moved on to satellites and how they can collide into other satellites. The last thing the author talked about was how many people care about all of the trash that is in space.,1," So the author goes from least importance to most importance.

23952,9,"The organization of the article is simple, yet very effective for the reader to truly understand the concept of space junk. In the beginning with the article called 'Orbiting Junk' the author creates an intresting lead in to draw in the reader. After that paragraph the author proceeds in the body paragraph to tell the leader about space junk and the dangers that causes to other satellites. I especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' I liked this because I had no idea that a tool bag would be such a treat if it was free-floating in space. I like how it discussed the damages it caused by using a metaphor about sand and the dangers it held.     Through this organization of introduction, body, and conclusion, the reader was able to understand how space junk is a serious matter.",2," I especially liked how the author ended the article because it told the reader how NASA is going about fixing the issue and how this is a never ending problem. Therefore the author’s organization structure is very effective.


# Grader’s Response


**Score:** 2

The student's response provides clear details about the article's organization structure and explains how the structure supports the reader's understanding of the concept of space junk. The student mentions specific sections, such as the introduction, body paragraphs, and concludes with a discussion of how NASA is addressing the issue. Furthermore, the student highlights specific literary devices used by the author, including a metaphor, that helps to illustrate the dangers of space junk. Overall, the student effectively supports their claim that the author's organization structure is simple yet effective."

Rationale: The student attempts to answer the question about the organization of the article but does not provide enough relevant details from the text to support their response. The student mentions that the author starts with questions, but does not specify how this relates to the rest of the article. They also mention that the article moves from specific to general, but do not provide evidence from the text to support this claim. The student's response is partially proficient because it provides some basic information about the article's structure, but lacks specific examples and analysis of the text. The student also includes personal opinions, such as thinking the organization is ""not very well"" and that it ""gets you to learn"", which are not directly related to the task of explaining the article's organization.

The earth will be in serious danger if the space junk keeps collecting.,1," Then he explains that it all got there from the previous space travelers, because they would just leave there things behind. The author says how the US and the Soviet Union were the first and then many countries then followed. They sent many satellites up to the earth with out thinking about the pollution it would cause. Then he explains how the satellites would brake and would just float around. The author then explains that the satellites that float around and crash with other satellites and create new debris. Then he gives many examples about how it happened. 

Score: 1

The student’s response partially explains how the author organizes his or her article. He or she summarizes the contents of the article and its main points, such as the source of the space junk and the problems it causes. However, the student does not fulfill the requirements of the task by directly answering how the author organizes the article, such as explaining the flow of the main points and providing structure of the author's organization. The response also does not cover the major points, including the examples given in the article about how space junk is a problem, and lacks sufficient supporting details from the article."
23563,9,The author firsts introduces 'space junk' then later on in the story goes in depth about how harmful it is. The author also explains where space junk comes from and how dangerous it is.,1," The author does in fact support the main idea with good examples.

# Score and Rationale: 

## Step 1: Identify the requirements of the task
The task requires the student to explain how the author organizes the article, supporting their response with details from the article.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response
The student's response attempts to outline the structure of the article, starting with the attention-grabber, then defining space junk, explaining its dangers to space travel, detailing the damage caused by debris, and concluding with the growing problem and the need for a global solution.

## Step 3: Evaluate the response against the scoring rubric
While the student's response does follow the general structure of the article and mentions key points, it lacks specific details and examples from the text to support their claims. The explanation is somewhat simplistic and does not fully demonstrate an understanding of how the author organizes the article to convey their message effectively.

## Step 4: Determine the score based on the evaluation
Given that the response partially fulfills the requirements by outlining the general structure but lacks detailed support from the text, it falls into the ""Partially Proficient"" category.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
24582,9,"The author organizes the article by starting off with a fun tone, and then changing up the tone to make it more serious. After the introduction, the author adds some the history involved with satellites and space junk. Then they talk about the satellite collision between the Americans' satellite and the Russians' satellite. Finally, after talking about the collison they talk about what is being done to try to help collect some of the space junk and explaining weither or not space junk is a big deal, or something that really doesn't need much attention.",2," 

This is shown as you read the passage and find that the space junk is becoming worse and worse over time. So as you keep reading the tone changes to show more worry. And the author adds more information like the satelites' collision to show the reader that this is a huge problem. Also, it seems to jump around topics pretty fast. This is probably because the author doesn't want a single event to overrule the importance of the other details provided.

I would be grateful if you could grade this student's response. Please use the provided rubric and clearly report the score and rationale for the score.

Rating: 1
While the student indicates the author starts with a fun tone and later provides history, the response lacks detail and jumps among the ideas without a clear analysis of how each part supports the author's overall organization. Student noted some structure, such as starting with history and a more serious tone, however, he could not connect the information effectively and used very general terms in describing structure and organization of the article. While student notes that the text jumps around topics, he does not critically analyze and assess the structure of the passage in order to determine whether this is effective or not. He rather takes jumps in topics and ideas for granted."

The student response identifies the organization of the text as sectioned and notes that the author uses this organization to explain the problem of orbiting junk. Although the response could be more detailed in describing how the author organizes the specific ideas within each section, it provides sufficient information from the text to support its claims. The response is proficient, as it fulfills the requirements of the task, and the information given is relevant to the task."

Lastly, the author changes to a more serious tone and explains how harmful space junk actually is.",1," Finally, the author ends the article with a strong conclusion to grab the reader. 

Rating: 

Rationale: This response seems to accurately convey some of the organization in the article but not enough for a 2. The author's response fails to mention all the different parts of the article (the 'What is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' sections). The response also only gives some minor details about each part of the organization it does mention but not the details required by the question. Since some of the requirements are met, it should receive a score of 1. 

Corrected response: The score should be 1. | The score is 1. | The problem with the response is it was too simplistic when addressing 'how the article is organized'.

The student response fulfills some of the requirements of the task. The student identifies some features of the article's organization by mentioning that the author starts with simple observations, defines and explains the main idea, changes tone, and ends with a conclusion. However, the response lacks specific details and supporting evidence from the article. It also doesn't cover all the different parts of the article, making it too general and simplistic. A more detailed analysis that addresses the various sections, such as ""What is Space Junk"" and ""Crash Course"", would strengthen the response. Score for following directions: 1 |"

Afterwards the article tells how the microdebris can destroy things launched into space and gives an analogy to give a picture. Then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing  and how it IS a huge problem.,2," The author used these details to bring about awareness to their topic and to end the argument in a serious tone.

Score: 2

Rationale: 
The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the author's organization, discussing how the text begins with a humorous anecdote before shifting to a more serious tone, delving into the history of space junk, describing its dangers, and explaining its potential disastrous consequences.

So 'Crash Course' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit.     After 'Crash Course', the next section is titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This is next because it talks about what can happen when two satellites crash into each other which was talked about in the last article.

The hook is good because it gets you excited and really wanting to know about the space trash which is called space junk.  A reader is more willing to keep reading to find out about space junk because the title caught their eye.  Once you understand what junk is and how much there is, you really want to know what is going to happen to our planets atmosphere and space around it.

The response fulfills some of the requirements of the task but does not provide information that is fully developed. It generally lacks supporting details from the article beyond mentioning that the author discusses the topic, the dangers, and what they are doing to stop it. The response does not mention specific details from the text such as the way the author provides background information in the beginning, explains the problem of dead satellites, space debris, and possible solutions. The information in the response is too general or not fully supported by the text."
23431,9,The author organized this article by making it into different sections to cover each topic. He made a title for each section that focused on a different topic.,1," For instance, the first section was titled ""what is space junk"" and it covered what it was and how it happened. After that, he used a new title ""Crash Course"" to talk about satellites that crashed together and also how astronauts have trouble with little things from space like tool bags. Then he moved onto ""Little bits but a big deal"" to explain why those things are so bad for spacecraft and how people are afraid of getting hurt."""

The student response is partially proficient as it generally describes the organization of the article but does not include details to support the description. Moreover, the response doesn’t break down the parts of the article (such as introduction, main points and conclusion) and it does not name those parts but vaguely states that author gives background information about space and then tells how debris becomes uncontrolled. 
````
## Step 1: Understand the scoring rubric
The scoring rubric ranges from 0 to 2, where 2 points indicate a proficient response that fulfills all task requirements with relevant and text-based information. A score of 1 point indicates a partially proficient response that fulfills some requirements but may lack specificity or textual support. A score of 0 points indicates a response that does not fulfill task requirements due to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or missing information.

## Step 2: Analyze the student response
The student response outlines the general organization of the article, mentioning that the author starts with an attention-grabber, provides background information on space, explains how space debris becomes uncontrolled, and concludes by highlighting the significance of the problem even with small debris. However, the response lacks specific details from the article to support these claims.

## Step 3: Evaluate the response based on the rubric
Given that the student response provides a general outline of the article's organization but lacks specific textual evidence to support the description, it does not fulfill all the requirements of the task. The response is not detailed enough to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the article's structure.

## Step 4: Determine the score
Based on the analysis, the student response aligns with the description of a partially proficient response. It provides some information about the article's organization but lacks the specificity and textual support required for a proficient response.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"

Even the student recognizes that they couldn't identify where in the text explains the organization of the article (""IT DIDNT SAY HOW IT WAS ORGANIZED""). The student lacks to address this part and went for describing some information they got out of the text and not based on the prompt. Therefore, the student was not proficient."

This organization style makes it easy to read and understand, it is clear that the author wants to make a movement to stop the space junk.

# Rating & Rationale:

$1$
The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task since the student provides some basic details about the article's organization, for example, mentioning that the author uses headers and giving a brief overview of the main topics discussed. However, the response lacks detail when it specifically points out the organizational style. The response also contains some grammatical errors that inhibit response clarity. The final statement, ""it is clear that the author wants to make a movement to stop the space junk,"" does not appear to be supported by evidence from the text and seems more to summarize the student's impression rather than a response to the organization of the text. Overall, the response did not thoroughly fulfill the requirements.

# Please rate and respond


Score: 1


Here's the rationale for the rating:


The response is partially proficient because it generally answers the prompt and identifies organizational strategies in the article, such as the use of separate paragraphs and titles. However, the response could be more effective if it specifically explained how each section supports the overall organization of the article, or used text-based details to demonstrate its claims about the author's organizational strategy. The sentence about advantages of organization feels a bit disconnected from the main focus on how the author organized the article. Therefore, it receives 1 point."
23992,9,"First the writer grabs your attention with the introduction. Then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled 'What is Space Junk.' Next he talks about how the satellites in orbit now can get smaller due to the fact that they could run into each other causing more debry in the section titled 'Crash Course.' And finally thewriter tells us how the little objects floating around there now are a big deal and the more that the satellites break the more debry their will be in the future that section is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'",2," So that gives you the main idea to. I think the writer did an ok job on dividing everything that you need to know, in sections, but maybe it could have been broke up a little bit more so each section was shorter so the reader did not lose track of everything.


The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$
Rationale: 
The student demonstrates an understanding of the organization of the article by identifying the four main sections and explaining the purpose of each one. While there are some grammatical and spelling errors, the student’s response fulfills all the requirements of the task. The student provides specific details from the article, such as the section titles and key points made in each one, to support their answer. Additionally, the student’s critique of the author’s organization, suggesting that each section could be shorter to avoid overwhelming the reader, shows a good understanding of how the article could be improved. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 2."
23765,9,The author organizes the article by giving each subject he is talking about a sub heading and staying on topic. He also uses lots of statistics and supports them all.,1," He is well rounded in his research.

## Step 1: Determine the requirements of the task.
The task requires the student to explain how the author organizes the article, supporting their response with details from the article.

## Step 2: Evaluate the student's response against the requirements of the task.
The student's response partially fulfills the requirements of the task. They mention that the author uses subheadings to organize the article and stays on topic, which is a relevant observation. However, their statement about the author using ""lots of statistics"" is too general and not specifically supported by examples from the article.

## Step 3: Assess the quality of the student's response based on the scoring rubric.
Given that the student's response fulfills some but not all of the requirements of the task and lacks specific examples to support their claims about the author's use of statistics, their response falls into the ""Partially Proficient"" category.

In the last one they are saying how the Space Junk can harm Space Shuttles and all different kinds of things.,2," The other one is also saying how there are really no real solutions. The title in the beginning that we know is Grab Your Telescope! Look up in the sky! tells alot. In a few words the authors are actually telling people to be ready for something in orbit and actually also see a lot of other things. This tells me because the title is Grab Your Telescope! that it starts talking about how things get in orbit and how its also used. The ending paragraph shows how serious it is since it talks about that this problem is a big deal but can’t be solved. The author is letting us know that the space junk is still going around and really can harm alot. It also reminds us again that the Space Junk really is alot. And tells how its not really cleaned up.

The response, while trying to outline the overall structure of the article, suffers from some limitations. The opening sentence does not set up a framework for addressing the prompt, and the subsequent description of the organization is too simplistic and lacks clarity. The student seems to be aware of the article's progression from introducing the topic of space junk to discussing its risks and the lack of solutions, but the explanation does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the article's structure. Additionally, the student sometimes seems to be reiterating or summarizing the content rather than analyzing the organization. The text fails to provide explicit, well-elaborated evidence to support the student's claims about the author's organization."

# Your Response:
Rating: 1. The student response demonstrates a basic understanding of the article's structure and content, mentioning the titles and main ideas, but lacks depth and specificity. For instance, it notes that the section ""Crash Course"" discusses the issue of satellites colliding and creating debris but fails to provide insight into the significance of these events or the author's message. Furthermore, the response's tone is informal, using phrases such as ""just a intro,"" ""that's just talking about some junk,"" and ""oops, we got a problem,"" which detracts from the quality of the analysis. Although the student demonstrates some understanding of the text, the response does not provide a thorough examination of the author's organization of the article."

In the following paragraph about a crash course, it is stated in the text that in 2009, two communications satellites crashed into each other. By stating these facts and the use of the transitions throughout the text the author shows that the article is organized by fact or cause and effect. These facts and opinions are the basis of the organization for which the author uses fact and then the author's opinion on space junk. This information is essential to the reader because it lets the reader know the effects and the cause of space junk in the Earth’s orbit.


# Rating (and Rationale)


Rating: 1


The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task. The student attempts to explain how the author organizes the article but does not do so accurately. The student incorrectly states that the author organizes the article by fact and opinion, while the article is more logically organized by sections that introduce the problem, describe the issue, provide examples, and discuss the implications of space junk. Although the student provides some text-based evidence, it is not entirely relevant or accurately interpreted to support the student's claim about the article's organization."

Score: 1

Although the student provides some information about the organization of the article, such as the use of a question to hook the reader and the use of headings like ""Crash Course"" and ""Little Bits, But a Big Deal"", the response is not fully supported by the text and lacks detail. The student's own opinion about the article being boring is not relevant to the task, and the response could be improved with more specific examples from the article to support the student's claims. The student's writing also contains some errors in grammar and punctuation, which makes it harder to follow their argument. Overall, the response is partially proficient, but could be improved with more attention to detail and a clearer focus on the task."

The body explains space junk and shows how long space junk is present. The part of the body titled, crash cource, explains about a crash that created a ton of debris. Another part, little bits but a big deal, shows the danger of space junk. The text also states who is concerned by this. Then the author showed us why it is a big deal.
Finally, the conclusion states how the government and agencies are handling this. This is how I think the author orginized her article.

# Response

1. The student response provides a general outline of the article's organization but lacks specific details from the text to support their claims. The student states that the author ""had very good detail on space junk"" and ""had an excellent body,"" but they do not provide concrete examples or quotes from the article to demonstrate this. Additionally, the student's explanation of the body is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances of the author's argument. Therefore, the response is Partially Proficient and scored as 1."

In the beginning of the article, the author explains what space junk is and its implications. In the middle of the article, the author delves deeper into the problems caused by space junk like accidents involving satellites. The final portion of the article discusses what is being done to help solve the problem of space junk.

## Step 1: Review the student's response to identify if it fulfills all the requirements of the task.
The student's response attempts to explain how the author organizes the article but lacks specific details to support their claims. They mention the general structure of the article (beginning, middle, final portion) but do not provide concrete examples or text-based evidence to illustrate their points.

## Step 2: Assess the student's response for text-based relevance and accuracy.
The student's response contains some relevant information from the text, such as the mention of space agencies and the problem of space junk. However, it does not provide a clear and detailed explanation of how the author organizes the article.

## Step 3: Determine the score based on the scoring rubric.

The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task because it contains some accurate information about the author's organization, noting that the article has a clear introduction, a title for different sections, and a structured format for presenting different topics. However, the student's description of the organization as ""messy"" and ""kind of not"" lacks detail in explanation and does not address the author's purpose and technique beyond mentioning that the transitions allow readers to organize the information. Additionally, the analysis is rather simplistic, and the student could provide more supporting evidence and text-specific references to illustrate the author's organizational choices. Overall, the response is not entirely thorough or supported adequately by evidence from the text."
24236,9,The author organizes this article by highlighting the headings of each topic allowing it to stand out.  The author also uses rhetorical questions.,1," Another thing the author does well is the way the author uses transitions to connect between sentences.


# Answer
1


The rationale for this score is as follows: 

Although the student addresses how the author organizes the article, the details provided do not adequately address the prompt because they lack specificity and are overly simplistic. The topic headings in the passage that should be addressed in the response are: “Orbiting Junk,” “What is Space Junk?,” “Crash Course,” and “Little Bits, But a Big Deal.” In the student response, however, there is no evidence that the student has made an effort to understand the purpose of these headings. Furthermore, in mentioning rhetorical questions and transition words, the student’s discussion remains very general, offering no textual examples to support his or her claims. Therefore, the score of 1 indicates that the student’s response is only partially proficient in addressing the topic of the article’s organization."
24409,9,"The author organizes the article by first, catching your attention with a surprising question.

The seriousness is emphasized by giving statistics such as traveling at 20,000 miles per hour.



# Your Response:

Score: 1



The student response contains some evidence that the student understands how the author of the passage organized the article. The student correctly identifies that the author begins with an attention grabber, proceeds to explain the concept of space junk, and highlights the problems associated with it. However, the response falls short of achieving a proficient level. The student fails to elaborate on the organizational structure beyond the introductory paragraph, does not provide enough textual evidence to support their claims (for instance, they only mention one statistic but fail to show how it supports the author's organization), and the explanation of the author's organization is somewhat simplistic. A clearer example of how the author uses transitions between sections, the use of specific examples to illustrate points, and how these elements work together to emphasize the seriousness of the subject matter would have elevated the score to proficient.
The best answer is 1."
24653,9,"The author organizes this article by grouping different information together. Under 'What Is Space Junk?', an explanation is given of what it is. Under 'Crash Course', the author talks about examples of when space debris has become a problem to space exploration.",1," Then under 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', it talks about possible effects of space debris on the future of space travel. This type of organization makes sense because first the reader must understand what space junk is, before being able to understand the problem that it causes to space travel. It would be confusing for the reader to hear that space debris caused significant damage before hearing what space debris is.



# Grading Response

## Step 1: Review the scoring rubric to understand the requirements for each score.
The scoring rubric indicates that a response of 2 points is proficient and fulfills all the requirements of the task, providing relevant and text-based information. A response of 1 point is partially proficient, fulfilling some requirements but may lack specificity or textual support. A response of 0 points does not fulfill the requirements, containing inaccurate, incomplete, or missing information.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response in relation to the prompt.
The student's response directly addresses the prompt by explaining how the author organizes the article. It mentions specific section titles from the article, such as 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and provides a brief description of what each section covers. The response also justifies why this organization makes sense, showing an understanding of the author's structure and its effect on the reader.

## Step 3: Determine if the response fulfills all the requirements of the task.
The response is text-based and provides relevant details from the article to support the student's explanation of the author's organization. It clearly and logically explains how the author structured the article and why this structure is effective, thus fulfilling all the requirements of the task.

## Step 4: Choose the appropriate score based on the analysis.
Given that the response fulfills all the requirements of the task, providing specific details from the text and a clear justification for the author's organizational choices, it merits a score of 2 points according to the scoring rubric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

In passage What Is Space Junk, tells us that the Soviet Union launched the first artificial sattellite and that was the begaining. The third passage, “Crash Course” the writer is talking about when dead sattellites run the risk of colliding with each other. Finally, “Little Bits, But a Big Deal” tells us who cares about a last tool bag or tiny bits of space trask. The author does a good job organizing this artcile. The writer used great text structure and different passages.

Your score is 1. 

The student partially fulfills the prompt with general descriptions of how the author organized the article. The student lists and describes the main idea of each passage, but this analysis lacks depth and specific details from the text that can explain the author's organization choices. For instance, the student could have observed structural elements such as the use of a hook (""Grab your telescope!"") to intrigue readers in the first passage or the way the author employs logical cause-and-effect relationships in the second and third passages to develop the topic. Overall, while the student identifies the different sections and their main ideas, the explanation does not delve deeper into the text's organizational structure or employ evidence from the article to fully support their claims."

The response does not fulfill the requirements of the task. The student does not provide relevant evidence to support their description of the text organization. Examples of organization structures include introductory paragraphs, definitions, chronological order, comparative structures, transitional phrases, conclusion sections, or any other structures that logically organize the piece. In contrast, this student response is very brief and provides little organizational analysis beyond calling the opening lines of the text a ""catchy way"" to engage readers. Additionally, the student seems to include an unrelated opinion at the end of their response (""I wish I would not have looked up at the sky that night"") that is not relevant to how the article is organized.

In the final section called little bits but a big deal he talks about why it is important to fix this problem.,2,"  So the author organizes the article by taking us through the history of space junk through the dangers of it and ends with why we should clean it up.
## Step 1: Determine the requirements of the task
The task requires the student to explain how the author organizes the article, supporting their response with details from the article.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response
The student's response attempts to break down the organization of the article into sections, mentioning the introduction to space junk, a brief explanation of the space age, the dangers of sending objects into space, and the importance of fixing the problem.

## Step 3: Evaluate the student's response based on the rubric
The student's response provides a general outline of the article's organization but lacks specific details and quotes from the text to support their claims. They mention the section titles but do not delve deeper into the content of each section.

The student gave a reasonable effort to explain the author's organization. They recognized the ""different sections"" of the article and appropriately identified them as ""hook and intro,"" ""background info,"" ""statistics,"" ""current matters,"" ""examples,"" and ""conclusion."" However, the student could have added more supporting details from the text. For instance, they mentioned that ""the author says it's a concern of many people"" but failed to mention that the author also stated concerns about a lost tool bag and collisions of satellites. The student could have also delved deeper into the organization and looked more closely at the relationships between the different sections. Instead, they touched the surface in identifying the various parts. In addition, there were mistakes and oversimplifications in the student's writing, like stating that ""the author explains what can be done about it."" In actuality, the article expresses a current inability to come up with a solution for space junk.

The student response does not fulfill the requirements of the task, as it does not elaborate much about the ""hook"" used by the author in the introduction or how the categorized paragraphs help a reader better understand the organization of the article. Moreover, they do not provide enough analysis to support their claims about the organization beyond stating it. They also misspell several words including ""interesting"" and ""important"". Additionally the student does not support their conclusion about the article by providing specific text examples.

The student's response provided some of the correct information about the organization of the article. It provided a good and clear thesis statement explaining how the student believes the author organized the article. However, this is the only part where the organization structure was mentioned. The student's response would greatly be improved with supporting evidence from the text to explain how space junk is defined as a topic early in the article, and its effects are examined afterwards. Furthermore, most information is general and could be improved further with more evidence. Therefore, the response partially fulfills the requirements of the task. For scoring range, the response is placed at a score of 1.

# Your Rating and Justification: 

1.

Although the response provides some information relevant to the prompt, which is how the author organizes the article, there are some limitations. The student partially fulfills the requirements of the task by mentioning the article sections (""What is Space Junk"", ""Crash Course"", and ""Little Bits, But a Big Deal"") used by the author to organize the content. The response indicates a sense of the author's organizational structure. However, the student's description of what is contained in each section is simplistic (""talks about what it is,"" ""how space junk moves when it has no control,"" etc.) and lacks detail from the actual text to support their claims. Moreover, the last sentence seems to veer away from discussing the article's organization to talking about the risks associated with space junk, which, while relevant to the topic, is not directly relevant to the prompt. Overall, the student's response is somewhat general and lacks the specifics and textual support needed for a proficient response."

The best answer is 1. Although the student is able to describe the basic structure of the passage, providing instances of an ""attention getter"" and ""starting facts"", additional specific details from the text, to support their argument, are not provided.

# Rating: 1
# Rationale: 
The student has partially proficently organized the items in the article according to the prompt. The student mentions a catchy introduction (""Grab your telescop...""), history (1957 launch of first artifical satellite), and the discussion of an event related to this subject (crash of satellites in 2009). However, the student does not clearly organize the overall text. The student fails to mention how the author specifically divides the section (""What Is Space Junk?"", ""Crash Course,"" ""Little Bits, But a Big Deal""). Also, the response seems rather brief as to how the author organizes it using transitions and details to connect the sections of the reading passage.

Rationale:
The student's response partially fulfills the requirements of the task. It describes the main components of the article's organization, mentioning the introduction, explanation of space junk, the Crash Course section, and the attempt to solve the problem. The response also attempts to provide supporting details from the text. However, the response is too simplistic and lacks text-specific evidence to support the description of the organization. The summary of each section is also not entirely accurate, such as stating that people are getting mad because something could land on earth (the text actually emphasizes the dangers of small debris to operational spacecraft). Overall, while the response conveys a basic understanding of the article's structure, it is not detailed or text-based enough to justify a proficient rating."

Based on the student's response, I would rate it as 1 point: Partially Proficient.

The student's response attempts to describe the organization of the article, but the description is too general and lacks specific details from the text. The student mentions that the author ""goes into details about what the space junk really is"" and ""explains what's happening because people can't see it with the human eye,"" but these statements could apply to many different parts of the article. The student also fails to provide clear and specific examples from the text to support their claims. Additionally, the student's sentence structure and wording are not clear, making it difficult to understand their argument. Overall, the student's response demonstrates some understanding of the article's organization, but it is not thorough or well-supported."

How was the response generated by the AI? 

This generation process can be broken down into these steps:
1. Scoring the response according to the rubric.
2. Writing a rationale for the rating.


After that, it just printed out the final response with the rating and the rationale.


To score the student's response, the AI looked to see if the response provided text-based information that was relevant to the prompt, in this case the prompt that asked how the author organizes the article. The student correctly noted that 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' are the three parts to the article. 


The AI also looked to see that the information could be verified by the text of the reading passage. The parts listed can be found in the passage.


In terms of writing the rationale, the AI also took note that the student stated that the parts were all about space junk in particular or space stuff in general.


So, because the student's response was correct, with evidence and the information within the text of the passage was verified, a score of ""2"" (Proficient) was assigned. 


The AI then generated a rationale in paragraph format that explained that the student's response was complete and verifiable.


Finally, the AI wrote a final response with the rationale. This final response was printed out along with the rationale. And that's the entire process. You can imagine it for the rest of the prompts and responses. ```

In this next paragraph, he compares sand to the tiny bits if trash. Saying how big of a damage it can be.",1," Finally, the author says there is really no way to stop all the junk but the only thing it can do is get worse.

The final answer is: 2

The rationale for the given score:

The student's response provides a clear outline of the article's organization. The student explains that the author begins with attention-grabbing statements, then defines space junk. The student then describes how the author explains the potential dangers of space junk, including the collision with other satellites and the impact of small debris. The student also mentions the comparison made by the author between sand and tiny pieces of trash to emphasize the potential damage. Finally, the student concludes that the author ends by stating that there is no easy solution to the problem and that it will continue to worsen.

24443,9,The author organizes this article intofour smaller articles that all have an overlying topic that is 'space junk'. This allows the reader to take in as mcuh information as possible. It also allows the reader to know where specific details come from and find them very quickly.,2," In a broad veiw you could say that the author sets up an introduction, it introduces what the author will be talking about. This then breaks off into four main categories that all hold specifc information on the topic of 'space junk'.  These are categorized into, introdution, explination of what space junk is, the crash course portion of the article, and how it effects space. The author takes it one step further by giving a name for each of these catergories and using it as a title. This makes it very easy for the reader to make a point on what area of the subject he wishes to know more about. By organizing the text like this it also helps the reader not get overwhelmed by the vast amount of information the article gives.

Then there is a part called “Crash Course” explaining the issue by telling us of an event in February 2009 when two satellites crashed. There’s also a part where it talks about how small objects can be just as important and damaging as big ones. Since it shows the organization is good overall and effectively conveys the information, I would say the organization is effective.

# Rationale: 

The student receives a score of 2 because the student's response fulfills all the requirements of the task. The student provides relevant text-based information to support the identification of the organizational elements within the article, such as identifying the use of an introduction, providing specific examples of text segments like ""Crash Course"", as well as referencing how the article explains the issue caused by small objects. While the response could be improved by mentioning the other section headings or by providing more specific examples from the text, the student adequately analyzes the overall organization of the article and provides sufficient examples of text-based structures.

They do this in the beginning by telling us about the amount of items in space and how it’s becoming a problem. Then it explains some of the reasons to be scared. Also, it explains how things are being looked over and how spacecrafts are being protected.
So basically, the author starts with things being brought to our attention, then they explain why it’s a problem, and then they end it with what is being done about the problem.


## Step 1: Read the prompt and the rubric
The prompt asks the student to explain how the author organizes the article, and the rubric assesses the response based on whether it fulfills the task requirements, provides relevant text-based information, and is accurate and complete.

## Step 2: Analyze the student's response
The student's response attempts to explain the organization of the article by breaking it down into three parts: introducing the problem, explaining the risks, and discussing the solutions. The student provides some general information about the article's structure and content.

## Step 3: Evaluate the response based on the rubric
The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task, as it attempts to explain the organization of the article. However, the information provided is too general and simplistic, and the student could have supported their response with more specific details from the text. The response does not fully meet the requirements of the task.

## Step 4: Assign a score
Based on the analysis, the response is partially proficient and warrants a score of 1 point.

# Grading: 1 point


# Explanation:
The response partially fulfills the requirements of the task. The student partially understood the organization of the article, describing a pattern using the subheadings in the article (What is Space Junk? and Crash Course) and providing some details based on each question. However, the response could be more comprehensive, providing more detailed information, and discussing the overall purpose of the organization used. For example, the student did not notice the question about the tool bag and the title Grab your telescope!, and only mentioned three different parts while the text actually contains five: Orbiting Junk, What is Space Junk, Crash Course, Little Bits But A Big Deal, and  two paragraphs at the end without a title but explaining the problem of space trash. Additionally, the writer was not able to explain the purpose of the overall organization and how this structure helped to develop the author's argument. Some examples are too simple and do not provide detailed information as illustrated by the lack of explanation of what was the content of the third title 'Little Bits But A Big Deal.' These weaknesses preclude a 2-point score.

In the twenty-first century, the typical workday for many employees worldwide is beginning to look differently. While employees used to be required to sit for nine hours a day at a desk, today we recognize that the key to worker productivity is to prioritize and organize flexibility.

Flexibility with Location

The number of workers who call the office their primary workplace is decreasing.  With modern technological advances, workers are no longer tied to traditional desks; rather, many now work remotely.

The response is not proficient. The student response is too simplistic. It does not describe the organization of the article and does not support with relevant details from the article. Some events are not even accurate, as the student reported the satellites crash in ""2008 or 9"" while it was specifically on February 2009, according to the passage.

Also, the last part tells you that the problem is getting worse more satellite space junk has been made even some space missions are just leaving the space junk in space. So it has many causes which the author wants the people to know about what's going on up there with the space junk. The author ends it with hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a solution to space pollution. The author just made articles into 3 part and it explains how the space junk was introduced to space to what causes it and how severe the problem is right now.

# Actual answer: I can’t tell what a proficient answer looks like. 


I will rate the student 1, but can you confirm how many points you would rate the question based on given rubric or if it should be revised to 2? 

Based on the given prompt, to receive 2 points for Organization of Article, the response must describe the parts of the text AND show their function in creating an organized whole. However, this response does mention the parts of the text and mention what happens in each part of the article, a good start. But, the organization of the different parts of the article can be more clearly described as a cohesive whole. So 2 points are not applicable for this.


I would rate it 1 point because while some general information is presented from the text about the organization of the article, it can still be improved much better.


Also, we do not know what a proficient answer and a partially proficient answer would look like on the given prompt for ""Organization of Article Item"". So we can’t rate it accurately without the exemplars of each score.  There are only descriptions but not actual examples provided for the prompt.
I agree that based on this prompt there are a clear and a concise paragraph that could answer it more sufficiently.

## Step 2:  Evaluate the student's response based on the scoring rubric.
The student's response provides a general outline of the article's organization and covers the main points. However, the details are somewhat simplistic and not fully supported by specific examples from the text. The response does not clearly refer to the sections of the article or provide a nuanced understanding of how the author organizes the information.

The response accurately states that the article covers the start of space exploration, the creation and presence of space junk, the dangers it poses, and lastly the solution to this problem. However, the claim that the article is organized by a timeline is not entirely accurate since the text is more organized by ideas or problems related to space junk, starting with its existence, then its causes, then the dangers, and finally, potential solutions. Furthermore, the response lacks detail specifically about how the author supports the organization of each part of the article. 

Please let me know if the answer is okay."
