15477,6,Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.,2
14397,6,passive transport is when the substance can move freely through the cell membrane.,0
15229,6,cells use severa;l diffrent processes some examples are how the cells use the nucleus to manuver and plan the movements that allow the substances to travel across the cell wall. some of the cells use their ribosomes to manuverthem. then they could also use their endoplasmic reticulum or their ER to make this process possible. this is only a few posible ways that cells could control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.,0

15060,6,"There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.",1
