# Teacher's Response:

Score 1.

The response demonstrates a fundamental understanding of how pandas and koalas are similar as they have similar feeding habits, both in a particular plant almost exclusively. It also differentiates between both and pythons who are not picky eaters and consumes various things, including animals. However, the depth of response is limited for example, it lacks in understanding how both pandas and koalas are specialists, unlike snakes, that are categorized as a generalist. Also, we would like to see some extension of the ideas presented in the text. The conclusion is also unclear. Hence, a score of 1 would be more suitable.",1
5973,3,"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in the sense that they are both specialist species which live in a very specific enviornment. On the other hand, a python is a generalist and can move between climates.",0," According to Maclnnes, specialist species like pandas and koalas thrive best in stable environments. Specialist species generally do poorly in times of change unlike generalists. On the other hand, generalist species do well with change as Maclnnes said ""What favors generalists is change.""

# Rating & rationale:

I'll provide my rating and rationale below. Please provide your rating and rationale.

Rating:


Rationale: Student responses are scored on how adequately they describe a relationship between pandas, koalas, and pythons, and whether they support their answers using relevant information from the text.



Please go ahead. I'll check if we are in agreement. In the real test, this part is evaluated using a 2-level rubric. I have taken the relevant part of the rubric here for explanation purposes only. Do provide a complete rubric if you can and feel it is relevant.



Please report only the score. Explain rationale.



Also, I must tell you that in this question students are given a figure which maps out the entire United states, which shows in the python habitat. But here we will assume ""Most of them are in the southern part of the United States"" gives adequate information to that effect.



The student response is very narrow. But it doesn't completely fail to cite some relevant text evidence.



And it only addresses a very small part of the prompt, how are pandas, and koalas similar.



The response also uses quotes unnecessarily, which is not required.



This can potentially be seen with the Score 1 description in which it mentions that it ""may include some inferences, connections between ideas in the text.""



Rating: 1



Rationale: The student response demonstrates some understanding of the similarities between pandas and koalas by noting that they eat specific types of plants. Although the student response includes direct evidence from the text, the quotes seem unnecessary and don't significantly enhance the point being made. Additionally, the response only partially addresses the prompt by focusing solely on the similarities between pandas and koalas, failing to adequately explore the differences between these species and pythons beyond stating their different habitats and biological classifications.

6650,3,"Pandas and koalas are specialist animals. Specialist animals are animal that need a specific enviroment to survive. For example pandas and koalas eat almost only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. Pythons are generalist species meaning they thrive on change. They can potentially live anywhere from humid Florida, to arid Lexas to busy California to even cold Delaware.",1," Pythons have already caused problems in Florida where they hunt down and kill 5 endagered species including the Key Largo wood rat. Unlike pythons pandas and koalas do not thrive on change and have specific needs to survive. In other words while pythons can live almost everywhere pandas and koalas are adapted to one environment making them both special.

Also pythons are nonnative species, but pandas and koalas are native species in their own countries. This proves that pandas and koalas are both similar because they are both adapted to one native habitat, but differ from pythons because they cannot be located in various environments. The author’s statement about pythons can be located in many environments “Right now, mankind has chosen to make Earth a rapidly changing place” proves that as the article stated the world now favors a society of generalists not specialists.

The student demonstrates a clear and thorough explanation of the comparisons and differences between the pandas, koalas, and pythons. They provide evidence from the article to support their statements, such as the definition of specialists and generalists, as well as the dietary habits of pandas and koalas. The student also goes beyond summarizing the article by drawing insightful connections between the concepts and using them to explain why pandas and koalas are similar and different from pythons. They also provide supporting evidence from the author's statement to reinforce their points.

This explains why pandas and Koalas are like each other. This is different from Pythons because, according to Figure 1, their habitat is almost all over America.

The Student response got a score of 2.

Rationale: The student response demonstrates a strong understanding of the similarities and differences between pandas, koalas, and pythons. The student cites specific information from the article to support their claim, such as the quote about pandas and koalas being specialists and the information from Figure 1 about python habitats. The student also makes a logical connection between the concepts of specialists and generalists, recognizing that pandas and koalas are limited to specific habitats and diets, whereas pythons can thrive in a variety of environments. The student's response is clear, concise, and well-supported by evidence from the text, demonstrating a strong conceptual understanding of the topic.",2
5975,3,"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they have very selective diets. The panda only eats bamboo leaves and the koala eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves.

These animals differ from the python by the fact that the python is considered a generalist, a creature that live almost anywhere. ""A generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach...""",0," (text, section 2).

The python is considered a generalist because unlike the panda and the koala it's not in need of a specific habitat and it can eat almost anything, whereas the panda nor the koala cannot without dying or getting very sick. By the text it can be noticed too that the generalist has an advantage over the specialist due to the fact that we are living in a time where the planet is undergoing many rapid changes and generalist are more effective at adapting to changes. ""What favors generalist is change. What favors specialist is stability"" (text, section 2). ""Right now, mankind has chosen to make Earth a rapidly changing place"". It can be concluded that the pandas and koalas are the same because of their eating habits and that they differ from the python by the fact that one of them is a specialist and the other one is a generalist.

Score: 2

This response demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the text by including specific, relevant information to support the comparison between pandas and koalas and how these specialists differ from the generalist python. The student extends ideas by making insightful inferences and connections between ideas in the text, such as recognizing that the generalist python has an advantage over the specialist panda and koala in a rapidly changing environment. The response thoroughly develops the ideas presented in the text by incorporating quotes and references to prior information, resulting in a clear and logical argument that supports the comparison between the three animals.",2

They are really different from chinese pandas and koalas because they aren't affected by climate change and stuff like Pandas and Koalas are.

# My analysis of student response:

The student response shows an adequate understanding of the text in describing and contrasting the diet of pandas, koalas, and pythons. The response uses information from the passage to describe the diet of pandas, koalas, and pythons; pandas and koalas are depicted as having exclusive diets, whereas pythons are characterized as generalists. The response could be better because the final sentence is difficult to interpret and introduces an unclear and unsubstantiated concept (""aren't affected by climate change and stuff like Pandas and Koalas are"") that does not appear to be linked to the relevant content. Overall, the response reveals a moderate conceptual grasp of the concepts presented in the text.

The student draws a clear comparison between pandas and koalas, citing specific similarities in their diets as herbivores, eating plants such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. This demonstrates an understanding of the concept of specialists as described in the article, where pandas and koalas are limited to specific food sources unlike generalists like pythons. The student also effectively differentiates pythons from the two bear species, noting their adaptability to living in various environments and their ability to thrive in and around humans, which is in contrast to the pandas and koalas that are more restricted in their habitat due to their dietary needs. The use of relevant information from the article supports the student's response and demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the ideas presented in the text.",2

The student response demonstrates limited and inaccurate exploration of the ideas presented in the text. The text describes pandas and koalas as specialists, meaning they have a limited diet, whereas the student response describes them as ""eco-friendly species"" that eat plants. Additionally, the text does not provide evidence that pandas and koalas are ""no danger to humans."" The comparison to pythons is also limited and focuses on the danger posed by pythons, rather than their characteristics as generalists. The response lacks depth and clarity, and includes inaccuracies, such as the claim that pythons can eat humans.

It's not only that, if bamboo were to become extinct, a panda would lose their home and food. As they rely solely on them, they have very limited access to many other climates with similar resources to adapt. This is compared to animals like pythons, that may be able to survive even outside their comfort zones, b/c these animals are more inclined to adapting to many different environments.

# Rating and Rationale

The best answer is 0. The response demonstrates limited understanding of the text, failing to provide clear and accurate information about the comparison between pandas, koalas, and pythons. While it attempts to highlight a difference based on diet, the information provided is inaccurate (koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, not bamboo, and there is no mention of bark in the article or that koalas eat bark). The response also includes irrelevant personal preference (""I like koalas better than pythons"") and lacks a clear and logical explanation of how pandas and koalas are similar beyond a misinterpreted detail about their diets.",0

Pythons are dangerous and pandas and koalas arent as much.,0," Pythons are like to [as] live in different climates, but panda and koalas can only live in warm and stable climates.

A Score.

As for your rationale, here:

A fundamental understanding is displayed by discussing a couple of common features between pandas and koalas: the fact that they are both specialized and do live in specialized and specific diets. Also, the response explains that pythons are different from pandas and koalas because they eat a broader range of food in different diets. However, certain ideas in the response like how it explained how pandas and koalas live in ""warm climates"" is not directly supported in the reading passage. However, the response does not demonstrate a strong understanding since the response did not explain what a generalist is and how that category of animals is favored in the modern world; ideas that are central to the reading passage. Nonetheless, the response gives quotes from the story and attempts to make some relevant connections, so it deserves a 1.",1
5415,3,Pandas in China are similar to koala bears because pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves so the author states in paragraph 21.

Also the python likes warm areas so adapting to China they would die.,1," For that reason pandas and koalas are not like pythons.

Reasoning Skill: Integration of Knowledge

Analysis:
The students explain how pandas and koalas are similar, by pointing out that they both primarily eat one type of food. The students also attempt to describe how pandas and koalas are different from pythons, by stating that pythons are not picky eaters and by describing pythons' habitats. However, students do not develop these ideas thoroughly and/or provide more evidence from the text.

The student's response demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the similarity and differences between pandas, koalas, and pythons, by providing examples from the text, such as specifics about their diet. However, the response lacks depth, including possible inferences and connections between additional ideas presented in the text. For example, the student could have expanded on their ideas by explaining how pandas and koalas are specialists while pythons are generalists, thereby making more insightful connections between the ideas in the text. Moreover, the response contains minor inaccuracies (""koala bear,"" pythons don't like China).

They are different than pythons because the pythons are spreading throughout the U.S. eating other animals.,1," Pythons have become invasive but pandas and koalas are not invasive, and are not causing trouble.


Score: 1


Rationale: The student provided a general response that connected ideas and concepts in the passage. He identifies the pandas and the koalas as animals that are not invasive and compared them to python which is invasive and is not native to the US. While the student provided a reasonable description of how pythons are not good for the ecosystem, he should have delved more into the relationship between pandas and koalas, their diets, and their habitats, and could have also provided further elaboration on why being a specialist vs a generalist is relevant to the comparison.

# Reasoning:

The student demonstrates some exploration of ideas presented in the text and a fundamental understanding of the text. He correctly identifies pandas and koalas as specialists and contrasts them with the adaptability of pythons. However, the explanation is concise and lacks further development and connections to fully expand on the ideas.

Also, the student seems to misunderstand some content in Paragraph 19. Generalists are described as doing well in and around humans and species that are abundant. This is not strictly about being picky about food. This slight mistake affects the validity of the whole explanation.

# Rating - Rationale

0. The response provides limited information from the text. It mentions pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists and eat only one plant. It also notes a key difference from pythons; however, the response indicates a superficial understanding of these similarities and differences, lacking depth.
The description of pythons as ""invasive and pandas are koalas are not"" seems simplistic and inaccurate as the text notes the python is invasive in the Everglades National Park. The response adds unnecessary and inaccurate information (""Because the weather is similar from China to Australia..."") suggesting a lack of comprehension of relevant textual information. Lastly, statements (""pandas and koalas are able to survive there,"" ""stay with what they know to do best,"" ""pythons... are able to adapt and are generalists and that’s why they can survive anywhere"") are not referenced in the text or are oversimplified.

The response demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the similarities and differences between pandas, koalas, and pythons, specifically referencing their dietary specialization and generalization. The response extends the idea of specialization and generalization to the notion that pandas and koalas require stability, whereas pythons are favored by change, allowing them to thrive in diverse environments. The student provides supporting evidence from the text, citing the specific examples of pandas eating bamboo and koalas eating eucalyptus leaves, as well as pythons being able to live in various regions, including the Everglades.

The student response demonstrates a general understanding of the text and provides some evidence from the reading passage to support the claims made. The student correctly identifies pandas and koalas as specialists and pythons as generalists, as well as notes their primary food sources. However, the response includes an error when stating that pandas can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space. According to the passage, it is humans, not pandas, that can live anywhere with the assistance of technology. This inaccuracy shows that the student lacks a more nuanced understanding of the text. Additionally, the response could be strengthened with more in-depth analysis and connections between ideas.

The pandas and koalas are completely opposite from pythons. Pythons can eat anything. Pythons are different from pandas and koalas, which do not eat everything because they do not have to. They know that one day their bamboo and eucalyptus leaves could get less, but snakes, or pythons, will never run out of their favorite foods because they eat frogs, rabbits, deer, and alligators.

Your Rationale:

Although the student's response offers information about how pandas and koalas compare and contrasts to pythons, that information is incomplete and somewhat mixed in terms of accuracy. While it is true that pandas and koalas eat only certain plants, the student mistakenly says it is a characteristic that does not include that for cobras - while no evidence indicates that cobras are deadly and indiscriminate in its diet, there is evidence that they eat meat, which they can eat without getting ill. It also mixes up the diet of cobras and that of pythons, but there is some evidence from the passage that pythons eat other animals in the Everglades. And some, but not all, of the student's comparisons between pandas and koalas are supported by the passage. Consequently, the student's extension of the discussion of the comparison between pandas, koalas, pythons and generalists that appears in the passage, is a mixed discussion, with some support from the passage, but does not seem to have great depth and coherence on comparing pandas, koalas and pythons.",1

The response demonstrates some exploration or development of ideas presented in the text. The response mentions the similarity between pandas and koalas regarding diet and adaptability to climate change. According to the text, unlike the generalist python, pandas and koalas are specialists who mainly survive on a specific food source. However, the extension of ideas lacks depth, and there are incorrect or unverified inferences. These animals are warm and fuzzy, which is one of the irrelevant points raised by the student.

The text describes pandas and koalas as specialists. The information that pandas and koalas each eat only one specific thing (bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas) is used to explain what specialists are. The difference between pandas/koalas and pythons is described as pythons being generalists. Pythons are also defined as adapting to many environments, unlike pandas and koalas, which live in a stable, specific environment.

I would rate this response as:

Score: 1
This student response demonstrates a good understanding of the ideas presented in the text. It correctly identifies pandas and koalas as specialists that require stability to survive, and it contrasts them with pythons, which are generalists that thrive in changing environments. However, the response does not further develop these ideas or make insightful connections between them. Instead, it simply restates the information from the text without adding depth or complexity. For example, the student could have explored the implications of the python's ability to adapt to different environments or discussed how the decline of specialists like pandas and koalas might affect ecosystems. Overall, the response demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the text but lacks depth and analysis.",1

The response demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the ideas in the text. It includes relevant information that pandas are similar to koalas in that they both depend on a single food source, which is bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus for koalas. In contrast, pythons can travel anywhere with the right climate and hunt small prey, making it a generalist compared to the specialist pandas and koalas. Also, the response highlights how the python’s threat display allows it to survive in many environments. However, the response is often vague in explaining how these similarities and differences are meaningful in a broader context. Overall, the response demonstrates some exploration or development of ideas but lacks depth in extending the ideas.",1
6205,3,"The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist species. They have a limited food source as the panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves. The python on the other hand is a generalist as it could live is a wide range. According to the map, the python can live on about a third of the United States; places the panda and koala probably could not live.",1," If a climate change occurs, they might become extinct. As RobRoy said, ""what favors generalists is change."" The pandas and koalas can only live in certain environments. This is why a generalist like a snake has a bigger impact on its surroundings when it's moved into a new environment. The pandas and koalas can only live in certain environments which make less of an impact when placed somewhere else. 

# Rating: 2

The student's response comprehensively explores and develops the ideas presented in the text. The student correctly identifies pandas and koalas as specialists, drawing on textually relevant information about their limited diets. They contrasts these species with pythons, which are characterized as generalists able to thrive in varied environments, as indicated by the map's depiction of potential python habitats covering a third of the continental U.S. The student also applies RobRoy's statement to understand how change favors generalists like pythons, whereas specialists such as pandas and koalas require stable environments to survive. These connections demonstrate a strong conceptual understanding of the text, which is further enhanced by inferences that relate the adaptability of generalists and specialists to their environmental impact.",2
6583,3,"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because, they are both specialists. They both eat a specific thing. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves while on the other hand a python also known as a generalist, eats just about anything. and can adapt. If you put a panda somewhere there weren't bamboo then it would probably die but if put a python anywhere it would probably survive.",1," Another thing is that both pandas and koalas won't live much if they don't live in the correct habitat. A python however is general enough that the everglades are similar to the Asian places because both pandas and Koalas can easily live without an animal called a, raccoon and a cockroach.

Rating: 

Rationale: The student's response adequately explores the ideas presented in the text. The student states that pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists and eat a specific food source. To provide contrast, the student accurately notes that the python, on the other hand, is referred to as a generalist that can eat just about anything and can adapt. The student also supports the idea that a python can survive in different habitats with an example drawn from the text noting the similarities between the Everglades and the python's Asian places. However, there are some areas where the inclusions are not directly relevant or lack clarity such as mentioning that pandas and koalas can easily live without animals like raccoons or cockroaches. Such comments detract from the response. Thus, the response shows an exploration or development of the ideas presented in the text, but a lack of cohesion and insight results in a score of 1.",1
6577,3,"Pandas in China stick with one type of food, bamboo. The koala in Australia sticks with one type of food too, eucalyptus leaves. A python, on the other hand is not picky. In fact there is a picture that is mentioned in this article "" A python swallowed an alligator"".",2," To flourish, pythons don't need a specific type of food like pandas and koalas do. A python would practically eat anything, even another animal that is a predator which is an alligator.

# Response Scoring and Rationale:

1. The student provides some relevant information from the text to explain how pandas and koalas are similar (eat one type of food only) and how pythons are different (no specific type of food needed). The example about the python swallowing an alligator supports the idea that pythons are generalists (compared to pandas and koalas). While the student demonstrates some understanding of the text, the response lacks depth and is mostly a summary of a part of the article. The student could have explored the ideas presented in the text more thoroughly, especially in terms of how all of these species fit into the context of the article (the experiment, the impact of invasive species, man’s role in environmental degradation). Further development of these concepts would have yielded a more insightful and robust response.",1
5240,3,"A panda is similar to a koala bear because neither one of them is harmful. They both only eat plants, and they don't really bother humans, so they're not a threat. They differ from pythons because pythons are harmful and they will attack humans.",0," They live in different weather conditions. That's how pandas, koalas and pythons are all different and the same.

You've been tasked to grade the student's response and provide a score, along with a rationale explaining your choice.

Please remember to use the provided scoring rubric. You only have to provide your score followed by a brief rationale. No lengthy review, just a clear explanation to justify your grade.

Here is your reply:

Score: 1

Rationale: 

The student demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the text by accurately noting that pandas and koalas are similar in that they primarily eat plants and do not pose a threat to humans, which contrasts with pythons. However, the response lacks depth in exploring these ideas. The student does not include specific relevant information from the text, such as the fact that pandas and koalas are specialists in their diets, which is discussed in the article. The response provides some inferences but does not extensively connect ideas or reference prior knowledge, remaining on a basic level of understanding. Therefore, the response warrants a score of 1 according to the rubric.",1
5880,3,"Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists and eat exclusively from one food source. Pandas eat mostly bamboo and the koala eats nothing, but eucalyptus leaves. They are different then the python because pythons are generalists. Because they can pretty much eat what ever they want. They have even eaten an alligator, before and they can live more place where the panda and koala cannot.",1," The koala and panda need their own special place to live where they can eat they same food always because if they go they will die. But python does not it can survive it can adapt. I think that is why python are becoming popular pet while the panda and koala are not. The article made that point that the popular animals now are not animal that are cute but ones that can adapt and are good at there environment in any other environment.

The final answer is 1.

Rating: 1

Although this student response connects the diet of the panda bear to that of the koala bear in Australia, it does not explore or develop the similarities and differences further. This is partly due to the misreading of the article. While the article did describe pandas and koalas as specialists who eat almost exclusively specific types of food, the student does not discuss that pandas and koalas are specialists and pythons are generalists which could live almost anywhere. This point could have been an opportunity for more elaborate connections to what was said in the article. Furthermore, the claim that ""Koalas and pandas are more important than pythons and should be taken care of before other animals"" seems to be unrelated to the preceding discussion and has not been previously argued in the response. Lastly, the statement that ""I do not agree that pythons are good pets"" is not relevant to the response and diverges away from the discussion. Overall, the student's response does not fully develop the idea presented in the text and thus earned a rating of 1 based on the scoring rubric.",1
5470,3,"A Panda from China almost eats nothing but bamboo, while the Koala bear from Australia eats eucalyptus leaves all the time. These two animals differ from python though as they have a certain food supply, while the python eats anything when it is hungry. I believe they want to show how animals differ with their food source availability.",2," I believe this because there are not many things for them to find food on, since they don't adapt to other foods, only one food source for them is going to work. Koalas and pandas, however, are more alike one another, since they have these unique food supplies that can show the reader, how different they are from like other animals.

# Step 1:  Review the student response according to the prompt and rubric.
The student correctly explains how pandas and koalas are similar in that they have specialized food sources, with pandas eating almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eating eucalyptus leaves exclusively.

# Step 2: Examine the student's understanding of the text and ability to make connections.
The student shows a fundamental understanding of the text, citing specific information about pandas and koalas, but their extension of ideas lacks depth and insightful inferences.

# Step 3: Check if the student's response demonstrates exploration or development of ideas presented in the text.
The student does explore the idea of differences in food sources, but this development is not deeply explored and lacks strong connections to broader ideas in the text.

# Step 4: Evaluate the student's understanding of pandas and koalas and how they differ from pythons.
The student identifies the primary difference between pandas/koalas and pythons - specialized vs. non-specialized diets, but their explanation remains surface-level.

The student's response demonstrates an adequate understanding of the similarities between pandas and koalas regarding their specialized food sources, and how this distinguishes them from pythons, which do not have such dietary limitations. While the student provides accurate information and draws the correct differentiation, their explanation is straightforward and lacks depth, insightful inferences, or broader connections to the text's themes. For this reason, the student's response is rated with a score of 2, indicating that their conceptual understanding is solid but lacks significant exploration or development of the ideas presented in the text.",2
6638,3,They are from the bear family and don't like to eat meat like pythons do when they are hunting for food.,1," They like to eat plant food that is found where they live. They like to eat only the eucalyptus leaves and bamboo. They do not like to kill their prey and don't eat any food from the animal category. They like to find a quiet place in trees to hide and sleep and don't like to come out during the day. They have four legs and move around slow so they can save their energy and don't get attacked by pythons. Their lives depend on eating plant foods that are available. Koalas and panda have only one food or diet plant. Pythons are different because they eat by wrapping and choking. And the snake don't go to quiet places for sleep and they are not afraid of the day so they go out anytime and anywhere. Pythons don't need to keep their energy because they have very slimy skin. This helps the animal to slip through the water and to move smoothly when they are going fast on land.

Rating: 2

Rationale: This response demonstrates a good comparison between pandas and koalas and how they are different from pythons in terms of food preferences, eating behavior, and physical characteristics that distinguish between slow-moving pandas and koalas, and fast-moving pythons. The student also includes the special diet of pandas and koalas with eucalyptus leaves and bamboo as examples from the reading text to support their explanation. Additionally, the student mentions pythons as hunting predators that have skin features that help them to move fast in water or on land. Overall, the student provides a detailed and thorough comparison of pandas and koalas with pythons that indicates a clear understanding of the text and support for their inferences based on relevant textual information.",2
6350,3,"The panda and the koala are both specialists. A panda only eats bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. These animals aren't dangerous animals. They're not known for eating alligators or rats, like a python.

I think pandas and koalas are better than pythons. Pythons are not very respectful creatures.

# Rating: 1

The student demonstrates a fundamental understanding by the inclusion of some relevant information from the text, which states that pandas and koalas are specialists that only eat specific types of food. The student also correctly states that pythons are generalists that can live almost anywhere, which is a point made in the article. However, the student's extension of ideas lacks depth, and the response includes some irrelevant and subjective statements, such as ""pandas and koalas are better than pythons"" and ""pythons are not very respectful creatures."" Additionally, the student does not thoroughly explain how pandas and koalas are similar beyond their diets, and the response could benefit from more nuanced connections between the ideas presented in the text.",1
6678,3,Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both part of specialist species. What differs these two animals from pythons is acceptance by humans. While all of these animals are specialized species a human would much rather hug a koala or be close to a panda rather that go near a python.,0," This is clear when they write that ""mammals are warm and fuzzy"" animals. What differs python is their species type. Humans tend to not want to interact with snakes. This can be shown when Jamie K. Reaser. says ""Mammals are warm and fuzzy."" Another thing that differs pythons from pandas is climate change. While humans are adapting to climate change pythons do much better with it. While animals like pandas and koalas are not. They adapt with a stable habitat.
Another thing that makes pythons adaptable is they live like humans. The species that have become most abundant are often those that do best in and around humans."" Allowing python to adapt around humans. This is why pythons would do more well in more places than pandas or koalas. With pandas and koalas humans have to work to preserve nature to have them in good numbers. With pythons they adapt more easily.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Pandas and koalas are similar because both are part of ""specialist species,"" meaning that they have a restricted diet and environment. The response provides relevant information from the text to contrast these animals with pythons, citing a quote from the text to highlight the differing perceptions humans have of these animals. The response also provides additional details about how pythons differ from pandas and koalas in terms of their adaptability in the face of climate change and human activity. The response demonstrates a fundamental understanding of the text and ideas, but may lack depth in exploring or developing the ideas presented, and the writing can be somewhat simplistic.
The best answer is 1.",1
5242,3,"Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia. Both are specialists meaning that they can only eat & survive in certain climate and region. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear,which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" The python however, is the opposite of a specialist and falls under the category of generalist meaning the can adapt to changes.",2," Unlike pandas and koalas, pythons can do well in multiple climates & regions. In the words of Maclnnes himself, ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability. Right now, mankind has chosen to make Earth a rapidly changing place."" To conclude, pandas and koalas are similar by being specialists, while being different from pythons who are generalist.
