Rationale: The student identified a stress level of Rose which can be considered as a trait, but this characteristic was not directly connected to her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab but rather her thoughts while considering the contest. The supporting quote was also not taken from Rose's conversations with her sister or aunt but a part of her thinking process. Therefore, the response only receives one point according to the scoring rubric.

Score: 0

This response is unrelated to Rose's conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab, failing to address the specific context required by the prompt. While the response does attempt to provide a trait of Rose (dreamy), the chosen trait and supporting detail (the dream sequence) do not align with the specified requirement of drawing from conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. As a result, the response earns 0 points according to the scoring rubric.",0

# Response:

Score = 2

Your response clearly identifies Rose’s character trait of caring based on her conversation with Anna and provides relevant supporting details from the text. You cited her concern for Anna's well-being as an example of her caring nature. Furthermore, you correctly highlighted Rose's efforts and contributions to help her brother Paul finish college, which demonstrates her caring nature. However, your explanation included minor inaccuracies, such as misinterpreting  ""are you okay?"", as ""are you worried?"", and also misinterpreting other details in the passage. In spite of this, since your answer clearly identifies the trait ""caring"" and correctly provides supporting evidence in the text, you have provided an adequate answer to both parts of the prompt.

# Rating:

1

# Rationale:

The student identified a character trait related to Rose as ""she isnt very happy"" and ""does everything for her family,"" which suggests that the trait the student is going for is ""selfless"" or ""dissatisfied."" While the student did provide a trait, they did not provide a specific detail from the story that supports their answer, which is required to receive a score of 2. The student's response only addressed the first part of the question.",1
17746,7,Rose is  careing person. She firsts askes her sister is she was okay. then Rose states that she and Anna play a big role in helping Paul finish college.,2," Therefore she shows she is caring for her family.


## Step 1: Identify the trait of Rose mentioned in the student response.
The student response identifies ""caring"" as a trait of Rose.

## Step 2: Determine if the student provided a detail from the story to support their answer.
The student mentions that Rose asks her sister if she was okay and states that she and Anna play a big role in helping Paul finish college as evidence of Rose's caring nature.

## Step 3: Evaluate the student's response based on the scoring rubric.
According to the rubric, to receive 2 points, the student must identify a character trait of Rose and provide a detail from the story that adequately supports the answer. Since the student did both, the response should receive 2 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",2

# Response: 

Score: 1
The student partially identifies the trait as ""helpful"" to describe Rose's character when chatting with her sister Anna or Aunt Kolab. Despite using other inaccurate trait descriptions and mentioning the unrelated feature, ""kind of quiet,"" the correct and correct partial assessment of the characteristic makes the response worth 1 point. The supporting detail demonstrates some level of connection to one of the necessary story details. Since the response only answers half of the prompt, it does not deserve 2 points.",1

# Rationale:

(Rationale response must be provided in a bullet-point format that directly addresses each part of the scoring rubric.)

*   Does the response adequately identify Rose’s character trait?
    *   Yes, but incorrectly. The student has identified a character trait that can apply to Rose, but it is not supported directly by her conversations with either Anna or Aunt Kolab.
*   Does the response provide adequate supporting details?
    *   No, the response does not provide adequate detail that is related to the conversion with either Anna or Aunt Kolab. The example mentioned does not specifically include her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab, but it generally speaks for her general behavior. The supporting detail in the second part does not support the answer to the first part completely. For this reason, the student score is a 1.",1
18532,7,"Rose tends to feel uncomfortable with expressing her inner struggles. While talking to Anna, Anna tells her, 'You sound just like Mama,' illustrating that Rose covers her feelings by saying what she feels is expected of her.",0," This makes Rose uncomfortable with her feelings and she says, 'we have to do it to help Paul finish college' instead of her opinions on her family's financial difficulty.


# Your Rating and Rationale

1

The student identified a character trait of Rose based on her conversation with Anna. However, the student’s reasoning is weak. It is not entirely clear if the trait 'uncomfortable with expressing her inner struggles' is consistently supported in this passage. This is because the student’s statement on Rose feeling that expressing her feelings is awkward seems plausible but the student should provide a more nuanced analysis of this scenario. The supporting detail to the trait seems somewhat coherent; however, it could be described more meticulously, and in the context of the overall story. So the student did not fully address the second part of the prompt adequately with textual evidence to advance their argument. Because of this partial response to the problem, a score of 1 is assigned.",1

18484,7,"Rose is a very caring daughter that just misses her father because, he is working in Las Angeles.",1," She said to Anna, “It is only been four months” so that means she misses him.


The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Rationale: The student correctly identified a trait of Rose (that she is a caring daughter), which aligns with the support from the conversation between Rose and Anna, that Rose tries to console Anna about their father’s absence. However, the detail provided from the story (""It is only been four months"") is used to support the fact that Rose misses her father, rather than to support Rose being a caring daughter. This does not fully support the second part of the question, resulting in the student being awarded 1 point for the partial fulfillment of the prompt according to the scoring rubric.",1
18156,7,"Rose is very caring. She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young.

# Rationale:
 
The student correctly identifies a character trait of Rose (caring) and adequately supports it with a relevant detail from the story, specifically the quote about Rose wanting to help her brother finish college so that he can support her and her sister's future education. This response meets the requirements of the prompt and demonstrates a good understanding of Rose's trait based on her conversation with Anna.",2
17631,7,"Rose is a very selfless character. She gives up so much time of her own in order to help her family, specifically her brother, and she can only hope that in the long run it will pay off.

Her reluctance in speaking her mind says that she values this relationship over her own desires.

Rating: 2

Rationale: The student has properly identified the trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with her aunt, which is selflessness. According to the rubric, the response should be related to the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab, and the response addresses Rose’s selflessness shown in her conversating with Aunt Kolab. The example used in the response, Rose’s reluctance to speak her mind when Aunt Kolab asks about feeling “weighed down by what she’s doing to help the family,” provides sufficient evidence for Rose’s selflessness. Therefore, the response should receive 2 points.",2
17538,7,responsible,1,". ""Do you feel so weighed down by what you’re doing to help this family?"" This statement that her Aunt Kolab says relates to when Rosa talks about feeling to young. That shows what a responsible person rose is.

Your rating and rationale: 

## Step 1: Identify the character trait of Rose mentioned in the student's response.
The student identifies ""responsible"" as a character trait of Rose.

## Step 2: Determine if the student provided a detail from the story to support the identified trait.
The student provided a quote from Aunt Kolab, ""Do you feel so weighed down by what you’re doing to help this family?"" and related it to Rose's feeling of being too young, which supports the identified trait of being responsible.

## Step 3: Assess the relevance of the supporting detail to the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab.
The supporting detail is directly related to Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, meeting the requirement of the prompt.

## Step 4: Evaluate the completeness and credibility of the response based on the scoring rubric.
The student's response identifies a character trait of Rose and provides a supporting detail from the story that is relevant to the conversation with Aunt Kolab, fulfilling both parts of the required response.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",2
18497,7,"One trait that describes Rose is that she thinks ahead of time. One detail that supports this is whe she says 'maybe her life would get easier, maybe it wouldnt'.",0," This shows that she knows that not everything will go as planned so you should always be prepared and have a backup plan in life.

The conversation of this trait is shown by the conversation with Rose's aunt Kolab because Rose's aunt suggested a plan to help her and that made her feel lighter because Rose was open to change.

# Grade & Rationale:

1

The student identified a character trait of Rose. But that trait was not supported by the details. Rose thinking ahead of time might be shown somewhere else. But in the given context that particular statement is an example of her uncertainty rather than thinking ahead. Additionally ""maybe her life would get easier, maybe it wouldn’t"" is a sign of her accepting the reality that things may or may not get easier rather than planning ahead. While Rose accepts the offer with an open mind, its still not clear how thinking ahead applies here.
This conversation is primarily with Aunt Kolab so meets that criteria for the prompt. But overall, it falls short in providing adequate support for the selected trait.",1
18224,7,Rose is a caring person in the way that even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to concern the rest of the family with the matter so she keeps it to herself.,1," So this shows that she is caring.


# Grading:




---

## Step 1: Determine if a character trait of Rose's is identified.
The student identifies a character trait of Rose, which is being ""caring"".

## Step 2: Assess if the response includes story details that adequately support the answer.
The student provides a general explanation of why Rose is caring but does not directly reference a specific conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab that supports this trait. However, the explanation does imply a consideration for the well-being of her family, which can be indirectly linked to her conversations, particularly with Aunt Kolab where she hesitates to express her true feelings to avoid causing concern.

## Step 3: Evaluate if the response should receive 0, 1, or 2 points based on the scoring rubric.
Given that the student identifies a character trait and provides a rationale that, while not directly referencing a specific conversation detail, does relate to the essence of Rose's interactions with her family members, the response should be awarded 2 points. However, upon closer inspection, the response lacks a direct detail from the story to strongly support the answer as specified in the rubric for a 2-point award. Therefore, it more accurately fits the criteria for 1 point.

The student clearly identifies a character trait of Rose, ""hopeful,"" and provides an example from the conversation between Rose and Anna to support it. The student demonstrates an understanding of the story by recognizing how Rose is able to express optimism about her brother's future and its potential benefits for her and her sister, despite her own struggles with work and family responsibilities.

# Score:

1

# Rationale:

The student response correctly identifies the character trait, which in this case is ""stubborn."" However, the response describes Anna as storming out of the room, not Rose. This response supports the characteristic with a detail from the story, but incorrectly assigns it to Rose. Had the student supported the characteristic by referencing Rose's reaction in her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab, the response would have scored 2 points. Since the student provides a partially correct response in identifying a trait, albeit for the wrong character, the response warrants a score of 1 point.",1
17127,7,"She feels weighed down. 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'",0," She feels that way because of her responsibility toward her family. She wants to help them but sometimes feels like it's too much for her to handle.

Rating: 2

This student receives 2 points for identifying Rose's trait of feeling weighed down and providing a relevant story detail as evidence. The student recognizes that Rose feels overwhelmed with her responsibilities, which is evident in the passage, particularly during her conversation with Aunt Kolab. The cited quote illustrates Rose's emotional state and the student correctly ties it to her feelings of burden.",2
18389,7,"Anna knows that no matter how stressful everything is on her, she needs to continue to reassure her sister and let her know that everything will be ok.

Your rationale is here. 

The response earned 1 point because while it did identify Rose’s character trait of being supportive, the incorrect subject (Anna) is listed in the first sentence of the response, and the narrative that follows, supports that Rose is strong, not the initial subject of the sentence.  This response would earn credit for identifying a trait, but the sentence before the supporting detail fails to link the character trait with the identified trait and narrative in the second part of the response. This prevented the response from earning full credit.",1
18022,7,"In the convorsation Rose had with her younger sister Anna, she seem to be strong. She was being postive about the situation with her father. I feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort, and make it seem like things arnt as bad as they seem.",1," In the story when Anna said ""Money ins't everything."" Rose responded with ""only if you already have everything."" This shows how rose thinks about money and that it dose matter in her family.

1) The character trait of the person in the story you identify is ""strong"",  (1 point)
2) you provide supporting details from the story. You wrote ""only if you alredy have everything"" and described it  (1 point)

I was supposed to give the score only. Here is my revised reply:
# Response:
2


# Rationale:
The student identified the character trait of Rose being ""strong"" based on conversations with her sister Anna, which earns 1 point. Then, the student provided a supporting detail from the story to justify her answer. The supporting detail in this case was Rose's response to Anna that ""only if you already have everything,"" which shows Rose's practical attitude towards money, which in turn exhibits a kind of strength in the family’s situation. Hence, the second point is earned. The student, however, could improve her response by being more articulate about how the quote supports the identified character trait of being strong and considering more nuanced and specific aspects of the story. Nonetheless, the student has met the minimum requirements of the two-point response. 

However, the student seems to have also made a spelling error and a couple other minor writing problems. The rubric specified here was a reading comprehension only, not writing competency. 

Accordingly, the score was not reduced despite the writing errors. For writing-related errors and for some improvement suggestions the grader's feedback could potentially be a helpful guide. Since I am not asked to provide feedback here, I conclude here.",2
17451,7,"Rose is a very determined person. You can tell this from the story, because she is working hard in the resturant, making dinner for her family at home, and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time. By reading conversations she had with her Aunt Kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person. Aunt Kolab says , 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' also shows that Rose is a very determined person.",1," 

## Step 1: Identify the character trait of Rose mentioned in the response.
The student identifies Rose as a ""very determined person.""

## Step 2: Determine if the response provides a detail from the story that supports the identified character trait.
The student provides several details from the story to support the trait of determination, such as Rose working hard in the restaurant, making dinner for her family, and writing an essay for a college scholarship. Additionally, the student mentions a conversation with Aunt Kolab, where Aunt Kolab asks if Rose feels weighed down by her responsibilities, which implies Rose's determination to help her family.

## Step 3: Assess the response based on the scoring rubric.
The response meets the criteria for 2 points because it identifies a character trait of Rose (determination) and includes story details that adequately support the answer, specifically relating to her conversations with Aunt Kolab and her various responsibilities.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",2
18038,7,"I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul.

Rating: 1

Rationale: This response correctly identifies a character trait of Rose by describing her as caring. However, the response does not directly answer the question as it asks for a character trait that is specifically supported by Rose's conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. The supporting details, such as helping Aunt Kolab and supporting her brother's goals, do not come from these conversations but are instead general examples from the story. While this shows an understanding of Rose's character, it does not fully address the prompt's requirement for supporting evidence from specific conversations.",1

In the paragraph above, the student correctly identifies a trait of Rose from her conversations with Aunt Kolab, and provides the details.

## Step 1:  Identify if the student identified a character trait of Rose.
The student identified Rose as a ""compassionate and caring person,"" which fulfills the first requirement of the prompt.

## Step 2:  Determine if the student provided a detail from the story to support the identified trait.
The student provided a detail from the story where Rose shows concern for her sister Anna by asking if she felt okay when Anna walked in rubbing her eyes. This detail supports the identified trait of Rose being compassionate and caring.

## Step 3:  Assess if the student's response adequately addresses both parts of the prompt.
The student's response identifies a character trait (compassionate and caring) and provides a supporting detail from the story (Rose's concern for Anna), thus fulfilling both parts of the prompt.

## Step 4:  Evaluate the response based on the scoring rubric.
Given that the student identified a character trait and provided a supporting detail, the response should receive the maximum points as per the scoring rubric.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$

Rationale:
The student's response effectively identifies a character trait of Rose as being compassionate and caring, and supports this trait with a relevant detail from the story. By doing so, the response fully addresses both parts of the prompt, thereby warranting the maximum score according to the scoring rubric. The student's ability to recognize Rose's compassionate nature through her interaction with Anna demonstrates an understanding of the character's traits as presented in the story.",2

Therefore Rose is protective of her sister Anna.

# Rating: 0

Rationale:
This response fails to accurately identify a character trait that is supported by the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. The response indicates that Rose misses her dad, which is not a trait and only a sentiment mentioned by Anna in the story. Furthermore, it inaccurately characterizes the family's motivations and situation. Therefore, it receives a score of 0, since it does not adequately address the prompt.",0
17116,7,"One trait of Rose's is reassurance.

One point is awarded for identifying a character trait of Rose. An additional point is given for including story details that adequately support the answer. In this case, the student mentioned that Rose is trying to reassure her sister that everything will be better, which shows a positive side of Rose.

# Score: 2

# Rationale:

The student identifies a plausible character trait of Rose, that she cares about her family's feelings and well-being, and supports this claim with a detail from Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab. The student notes Rose's reluctance to express her true sentiments to her aunt because she does not want to hurt her, thereby demonstrating an understanding of Rose's selfless nature. Overall, the response effectively meets the requirements of the prompt by providing a well-supported character trait of Rose.",2
17959,7,"According to this particular story, Rose is depicted as discouraged. The story explains how Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and Rose had no response, signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness.",0," There is ample evidence to prove this characteristic of Rose.

Rationale:
The answer receives 2 points. The student has provided a trait that adequately describes how Rose’s experiences with her responsibilities may have taken a toll on her when the student points out she is discouraged. The student provides evidence of Rose’s discouragement by pointing to the interaction with Aunt Kolab when Rose does not answer if she feels weighed down.

This response fails to provide a detail from the conversations that support the claim that Rose is caring. Mentioning the father being away, and how Rose wants to pay for her and her sister's college are not details that support that Rose was caring from her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. Although the response does correctly identify a characteristic trait of Rose, it did not comply with the requirement of providing specific support from the conversation as per the scoring guidelines.  The supporting evidence was actually from a part of the story outside of the defined range and this response should be rewarded with 0 points.",0

We know this because Rose says that she goes ""straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper"" and then does homework.

# Assessment:

2

While some statements within the response may seem extraneous or speculative, the student appropriately identifies a character trait of Rose within the context described in the prompt. It adequately provides a relevant detail from the conversation with a family member (although it happens to be a detail about Rose's schedule for the day, not a conversation). The response identifies resilience as a trait of Rose's and provides a specific story detail to support the answer.",2

# Your Response:

# Score:

## Step 1: Identify the character trait of Rose mentioned in the student's response.
The student identifies Rose as being ""very faithful"" and mentions that she wants her family to be happy even if she is not.

## Step 2: Determine if the student provided a creditable response to the first part of the question.
The student provided a character trait of Rose, which meets the criteria for the first part of the question.

## Step 3: Analyze if the student included story details that adequately support the identified trait.
The student mentions a conversation between Rose and Anna as evidence, specifically stating that Rose tells Anna ""everything will turn out for the best, it will just take some time."" However, this specific quote is not present in the provided reading passage. Despite this, the essence of the statement aligns with the passage's depiction of Rose trying to reassure Anna about their situation.

## Step 4: Evaluate if the student's response is related to the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab.
The student's response is related to Rose's conversation with Anna, which meets this criterion.

## Step 5: Assess if the student provided a creditable response to the second part of the question.
Given that the student provided a relevant character trait and attempted to support it with a detail from the story (even if not a direct quote from the passage), the response can be considered creditable for the second part of the question.

## Step 6: Determine the score based on the rubric.
Since the student identified a character trait of Rose and included a detail that attempts to support the answer, the response meets the criteria for 2 points.

This is supported by Rose's behavior when with her sister Anna and Aunt Kolab. Specifically with Aunt Kolab when she says ""In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal."" The implication here is that Rose believes what she has to do is not normal, which is correct but it can be argued as being self-absorbed. However, the response did not fully address the prompt's request for more than one detail or at least a more adequate detail from the story that supports the answer which is why the student received one point opposed to two.",1

# Rating: 1

The student response properly identifies a trait of Rose as diligent, which aligns with Rose's behavior and thoughts as described in the passage. The provided detail from the story supports Rose's diligence by highlighting the demanding nature of her days and her perseverance in helping her family and fulfilling her responsibilities. However, the response becomes slightly sidetracked with the student's personal statement about liking being diligent themselves, which is not directly relevant to explaining Rose's trait or supporting it with story details. Despite this, the response meets the criteria for 1 point, as it identifies a character trait of Rose and attempts to support it with a detail from the story. The second part of the student's response could be more effectively linked to Rose's trait by demonstrating additional insight or evidence from the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab, which is why a full 2 points are not awarded.",1

# Rating:

2

# Rationale:

The student has identified one trait that can describe Rose, which is being family-oriented. The student also provided story details to support this trait, pointing to Rose's decision not to reply to her Aunt's question about feeling weighed down by the family, in order not to hurt her. This shows that Rose prioritizes her family's feelings over her own. The response is directly related to the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab, making it a complete and acceptable answer according to the scoring rubric.",2
18599,7,"Rose can be described by the the word caring. She shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and Anna. When she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care. For example she says,'Whats wrong? You feel okay?'",2,"  she talks to Anna this way to make sure Anna is okay and can help Anna to calm down about her bad dream.


# Problem:


The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$

The response provided identifies Rose's trait as ""caring"" and provides a specific detail from the story (""What's wrong? You feel okay?"") to support the answer. The response is well-organized and clearly relates to the conversations with Anna. The writer adequately explains how Rose shows care when talking to Anna.

# Your Response:

The student identified Rose's trait, ""she loves her family,"" which is clearly supported by her actions, as in her listening to her sister and her aunt. The detail about listening is not explicitly mentioned in the prompt but it can be inferred that her care and attention to her sister, particularly in her concern when Anna said she had a bad dream and responding with empathy when Anna missed their father. Although the response is not sophisticatedly worded, it sufficiently answers the prompt by pointing out a clearly evident characteristic of Rose demonstrated in a conversation with a family member.",2

# Rating

The student begins their response by identifying one of Rose's character traits, that she is ""caring"". This is already a good starting point worth 1 point. They also include two examples from the conversation: one with her sister where she shows concern over Anna's bad dreams, and one in the statement where Rose emphasizes her and her sister's role in helping Paul finish college. This aligns well with the prompt requirements. Moreover, the additional elaboration on Rose's trait provides even more insight into Rose's motivations, showing why Rose might feel so driven to help her family, demonstrating an understanding of the passage's underlying themes.
It's worth considering, however, that providing additional traits beyond what was requested might usually be frowned upon as beyond the question's scope. Yet, in this instance, it demonstrates an analysis depth, further highlighting the identified character trait of being caring, and thus contributes towards satisfying the second portion of the prompt which requires supporting details. Therefore, the overall score should be 2.",2

So her trait is responsible.

# My rating: 2

This student does a nice job of supporting his or her response by citing the text directly. A character trait of Rosé’s is identified, responsible. The student elaborates on this by highlighting that Rose feels too young for so much responsibility. Additionally, the selection of text they provide “Paul's fate lies partly in these” supports this assertion well and demonstrates that Rose believed that she holds Paul’s fate in her hands. The writing is not perfect (some grammatical errors), but the student is able to communicate their point effectively and address both parts of the prompt.",2

When people lose their jobs and there is no income, families can starve or even become homeless. Therefore, a mature person would weigh his options and make sacrifices to ensure their survival. Rose does this when she convinces Anna that what they are doing for the family is worth it.


# Your score: 

1

# Your rationale:

The student partially addresses the prompt by identifying a trait of Rose, which is being mature and understanding. However, the detail provided from the story does not fully support this trait in the context of conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. The student's response relies more on a general interpretation of maturity and its relation to acknowledging the importance of money for survival rather than directly addressing how Rose's conversations with her family members demonstrate this trait. The student's explanation is plausible but does not fully meet the criteria for a 2-point response as it lacks a direct connection between the identified trait and a specific detail from Rose's conversations.",1

The student successfully identifies a trait of Rose which is 'caring', and provides several details to support this claim. The student specifically references how Rose still makes time for her sister despite the overwhelming task of her essay, which demonstrates Rose's caring nature towards her family members.

The final answer is:** $\boxed{1}$ **

Rationale:
She does make the effort to describe the underlying struggle Rose has in her life situation, she does not provide any description of her personal trait as such. She seems to have identified her personal situation only and then described it in general. The question also asks her to provide 1 detail from the story, which she did not.

One day her sister, Anna, woke her up and her sister help her by getting a cup of orange juice to help her to wake up and be fresh as she can but She didn’t say thanks to her sister or happy to her sister. That why selfish is my best trait to describe Rose.

# Your Scoring: 1

The student chose the trait ""selfish"" to describe Rose. This choice is valid based on the student's reading of Rose's behavior. The student noted that Rose ""never talk to her sisters or aunts nicely"" and seemed ungrateful for her sister's and aunt's attempts to help her. This demonstrates the student's engagement with the passage. However, the supporting detail provided focuses on what Rose does not do (saying thank you) instead of what she does do, and misinterprets the context. A more nuanced understanding would show that Rose is under immense stress, pressure and is just trying to keep things together. A better supporting detail could have included Rose's conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab that showcases her selflessness, such as her efforts to ensure that Paul can finish college. Despite this, the student did provide a character trait and attempted to support it, meeting the criteria for 1 point.",1

# Rationale:

The student response provides some information, but does not explicitly identify a trait of Rose. There is an attempt to support the answer with details from the story, but these details are not developed and do not clearly relate to the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. More importantly, no specific character trait is mentioned. The student's attempt at identifying Rose's trait is too vague (""very open with her family"", ""not worried what they think""), and not directly from conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab.",0
18289,7,"Rose seems to be very stressed. She has been going to school, working, and helping with chores around the house. Along with all of these responsibilities, Rose has to write a flawless three-thousand-word essay and she doesn't know how she is going to be able to complete it on time.  This is what is making her so stressed.",0," In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose felt that she needed to discuss the nightmare she had about her brother Paul. Aunt Kolab told her that maybe she was feeling overwhelmed by the weight of helping her family out so much. After Rose discussed the nightmare with her aunt, she felt a weight had been lifted off of her shoulders. This makes Rose seem more responsible.

## Step 1: Identify the character trait of Rose mentioned in the student response.
The student response mentions that Rose seems to be very stressed, but later concludes that this makes Rose seem more responsible.

## Step 2: Determine if the student provided a creditable response to the first part of the question.
The student did identify a character trait of Rose, which is being responsible.

## Step 3: Evaluate if the student provided a creditable response to the second part of the question.
The student included a detail from the story that supports the answer. The conversation with Aunt Kolab about the nightmare and Rose feeling a weight had been lifted off her shoulders after discussing it supports the trait of being responsible.

## Step 4: Apply the scoring rubric based on the evaluation.
Given that the student identified a character trait of Rose and provided a supporting detail from the story, the response should be awarded 2 points according to the scoring rubric.

The student has correctly responded to the first item, and identified a character trait of Rose, but failed to provide a well-supported response. The supporting example provided, that her aunt thinks that there's a way to make things better, actually does not directly support the trait ""wants to be free"" as identified by the student. The response demonstrates an understanding, but not as adequately supported as it should be.  This response would have more adequately supported its identification of a character trait if,  for example, it referenced a more  direct detail such as Rose’s statement to Anna that she feels like her life would get easier or her sigh of relief in response to Aunt Kolab’s offer of help, which supports that she desires to be free of her burdens.",1

# Rationale:

The student response identifies a character trait of Rose's - that she is scared. However, the detail provided does not come from conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab, but rather from the description of Rose's dream. The prompt specifically asks for a detail from the conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab that supports the identified trait. The student response does not fulfill the second part of the question, and therefore, scores 1 point.

Rationale: The student did not identify any specific character trait of Rose, which is required for the response to receive any points according to the rubric.

The word to use is responsible or maybe considerate but also the word caring.
The trait to use about Rose is ""family first"" trait. A way to see that Rose used the trait is that Rose says to Anna that what they are doing is only temporary. She is saying that they will soon not have to work late and make sacrifices if their brother graduates and then gets a job that pays a lot.



# Rating:​ 2 points.

Rose has been described as having a ""family first"" trait based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab.  She understands why her parents are working hard and her role in contributing to her family's financial stability. The student also included details from the story to support his or her answer; they note that ""Rose says to Anna that what they are doing is only temporary"" and ""they will soon not have to work late and make sacrifices if their brother graduates and then gets a job that pays a lot,"" thereby demonstrating Rose's prioritization of family well-being. The student's choice of trait ""family first"" is not one word, but it is clear in the context of the answer what the student intends to convey. The student has not provided the most precise story quote to support their response, but this is not required in the prompt. Overall, the response is strong in that it identifies a characteristic of Rose based on details from her conversation with Anna.

# Rating and Rationale:

## Step 1: Evaluate the student's response for identifying a character trait of Rose.
The student has identified a character trait of Rose, which is that she tries to hide the way she feels.

## Step 2: Determine if the student provided adequate story details to support the identified trait.
The student mentions that Rose does not tell her aunt how she feels when asked, which is a detail from the story that supports the identified trait.

## Step 3: Assess the relevance of the provided detail to the conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab.
The detail provided is related to Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, which meets the requirement specified in the prompt.

## Step 4: Assign a score based on the scoring rubric.
Given that the student identified a character trait of Rose and provided a detail from the story that supports the trait, and the detail is related to the conversation with Aunt Kolab, the response meets the criteria for a 2-point score.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$

Rationale: The student provided a complete response by identifying a character trait of Rose (she tries to hide the way she feels) and supported it with a relevant detail from the story (Rose not telling her aunt how she feels when asked).

This score reflects that the student has identified a character trait of Rose, which is patience. The evidence the student gives from the passage, however, doesn’t directly support that Rose has patience; instead, it shows that Aunt Kolab has a willingness to help and shows care for Rose’s situation. The student still receives a point as they provided a creditable response to the first part of the question.

The student identifies the character trait of Rose that 'she would like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not want to do it.' Although the student incorrectly includes quotation marks in the response without a direct quote from the story about Rose, it does not seem that the quotations are included to support a fact about Rose and, in fact, the quoted section does not support this character trait of Rose and does not even match quotes from the story. Therefore, the student does not receive a score of 2 since the provided story details do not adequately support the answer to demonstrate this character trait. The quotes actually are about Anna's feelings of loneliness and resentment for their mother's late hours, and do not support the idea that Rose is inflexible. The character trait would better be supported by a different quote that involved Rose's feelings, rather than Anna's feelings.",1

Rationale: The student did not answer the prompt accurately. The point is awarded for the student identifying a character trait—overburdened.

However, the evidence provided comes from a conversation with Anna, not Aunt Kolab, as mentioned in the prompt. The evidence also supports the trait ""caring"" rather than ""responsible"".

# Rationale:

The student failed to provide a correct character trait of Rose’s related to her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab. Although, there is evidence from the conversation in the passage that could be relevant to show Rose’s trait, such as responsibility, but the answer is not explicitly clear. For instance, they could mention 'responsible,' given that in the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose seemed to understand her family’s financial burden as she dreamed about her brother Paul holding his sisters’ fates on his hands.

The student accurately identifies a character trait of Rose as being ""loving"" based on her conversations with her family members. To support this answer, the student also provides a detail from the story: when Rose is thinking kindly of her family, remembering the graduation with Paul, and deciding not to hurt her aunt's feelings. This shows that Rose cares about the well-being of her family members and values their feelings, indicating that she indeed possesses a loving trait. However, one might notice that at the start of the response, the student seems to drift slightly off-topic, yet the main response follows the prompt.",2

The student correctly identifies the character trait of ""persistent"" as a trait that describes Rose based on their conversation with Anna, and provides a supporting detail from the story that illustrates this trait. The detail highlights how Rose is willing to keep going and do her part to help her brother finish college, showing her persistence in the face of difficulty. This meets the requirements of a 2-point response, as the student has provided a creditable response to both parts of the question.",2

# Rationale:
The student correctly identifies one trait of Rose–her difficulty or reluctance to express her feelings. The detail from the story that supports the answer is when Rose did not want to share her true feelings with her Aunt because she might hurt her or Rose’s mother. The student response correctly shows that difficulty or reluctance to speak truthfully when they write, “If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.” Additionally, the answer shows that the student realized Rose opened up to Aunt Kolap in the end. Although the response is flawed by grammar and spelling errors, it identifies a character trait of Rose and uses a story detail as support.

The student correctly identifies a character trait of Rose--that is, “understanding.” However, the conversation cited by the student is with neither Anna nor Aunt Kolab but rather an unspoken conversation that takes place within Rose.  Moreover, the cited example that supports the student’s answer does not directly relate to Rose’s conversation with either Anna or Aunt Kolab, both of whom had conversation with Rose to support the trait in question by one more related detail from the story. The student fails to provide a supporting detail from the story that directly relates to Rose’s dialogue with either of the speakers specified within the prompt.",1

Rationale: 

The test-taker has identified a character trait of Rose, as the prompt asked, and demonstrated a good understanding of the story. They correctly stated that Rose was 'stressed out' which is supported by the story. However, the test-taker did not adequately address the second part of the question which required the identification of one detail from the story that supports the answer. The test-taker only quotes a sentence where Aunt Kolab was concerned about Rose, but provided no explanation or analysis of it in the context of their argument. Also, they didn't clearly explain why they identified 'stressed out' as a character trait, which is more a feeling than a trait.

Rating:1

The student appropriately identifies that Rose is determined, which is shown in her conversation with Anna. However, the student’s description of the story detail as a supporting example is insufficient. While the student quotes Rose discussing the importance of supporting Paul, the quote itself doesn’t adequately demonstrate Rose’s determination.

The student accurately identifies a trait of Rose’s—mature—and adequately supports it with the conversation she had with her sister Anna. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the story, specifically the conversation Rose had with her sister Anna, where she stands up for her father’s decision to move to Los Angeles, noting that the family must work together to secure her and her siblings' futures through college education. This highlights that Rose is taking a responsible and objective position in the situation, thereby showcasing her maturity.",2

She also refers to a laugh that came no where near soundind sincere.",0,"  ''Rose felt too young for so much responsiblity.  Then she shivered, imagining how her brother must feel.  Only three years older he held the fate of two people in his hands.''

## Step 1: Identify the character trait of Rose mentioned in the student's response.
The student describes Rose as someone who tries to keep everyone happy by telling them what they want to hear, rather than expressing her true feelings.

## Step 2: Determine if the student provided a creditable response to the first part of the question.
Yes, the student identified a character trait of Rose, which meets the criteria for the first part of the question.

## Step 3: Examine the details provided by the student to support their answer.
The student mentions specific lines from the story, such as ""He had to go"" and the description of Rose's insincere laugh, which suggest that Rose is trying to please others. Additionally, the student references Rose's inner thoughts about feeling too young for so much responsibility and her concern for her brother, which further support the identified trait.

## Step 4: Evaluate if the student's response meets the criteria for a 2-point score.
Yes, the student provided a creditable response to both parts of the question, identifying a character trait of Rose and supporting it with relevant details from the story.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",2

With her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom, dad, or even Paul.",0," Rose is lonely but to proud to admit it.

The detail that proves this is when she is talking to Anna, ""‘Money isn’t everything,” Rose is trying to show Anna that she can do without their mom or dad. But Rose’s face also looks a little bit confused at times in the text. So I know that she has the same feeling like Anna does.

You have correctly identified that Rose is self-sacrificing, but the example you used from the text is not accurate. The quote you referred to was when Rose was waking up from falling asleep while working on her essay. It only shows Rose caring about Anna, but not necessarily sacrificing her own interest for Anna. In order to receive 2 points, a response would have needed to reference a specific conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab, and how this related to Rose's self-sacrificing trait.
